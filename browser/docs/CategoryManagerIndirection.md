Firefox
front
-
end
code
uses
the
category
manager
as
a
publish
/
subscribe
mechanism
for
dependency
injection
so
consumers
can
be
notified
of
interesting
things
happening
without
having
to
directly
talk
to
the
publisher
/
actor
who
decides
the
interesting
thing
is
happening
.
There
are
2
parts
to
this
:
1
.
Consumers
registering
with
the
category
manager
2
.
Publishers
/
actors
invoking
consumers
via
the
category
manager
.
#
#
Consumer
registration
with
the
category
manager
.
The
category
manager
is
used
for
various
purposes
within
Firefox
;
it
is
more
or
less
an
arbitrary
double
string
-
keyed
data
store
.
For
this
particular
usecase
the
publisher
/
consumer
have
to
use
the
same
primary
key
(
i
.
e
.
category
name
)
such
as
browser
-
idle
-
startup
.
The
secondary
key
is
a
full
URL
to
a
sys
.
mjs
module
.
Note
that
because
this
is
a
key
*
*
only
one
consumer
per
module
&
category
combination
is
possible
*
*
.
The
"
value
"
part
is
an
Object
.
method
notation
where
the
expectation
is
that
Object
is
an
exported
symbol
from
the
module
identified
as
the
secondary
key
and
method
is
some
method
on
that
object
.
At
compile
-
time
registration
can
happen
with
an
entry
in
a
.
manifest
file
like
[
BrowserComponents
.
manifest
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
source
/
browser
/
components
/
BrowserComponents
.
manifest
)
.
Note
that
any
manifest
successfully
processed
by
the
build
system
would
do
we
don
'
t
need
to
use
BrowserComponents
.
manifest
specifically
.
In
fact
it
would
be
preferable
if
components
used
their
own
manifest
files
.
An
example
registration
looks
like
:
category
browser
-
idle
-
startup
moz
-
src
:
/
/
browser
/
components
/
tabbrowser
/
TabUnloader
.
sys
.
mjs
TabUnloader
.
init
This
will
ensure
that
when
the
browser
-
idle
-
startup
publisher
is
invoked
the
TabUnloader
.
sys
.
mjs
module
is
loaded
and
the
init
method
on
the
exported
TabUnloader
object
is
invoked
.
#
#
#
Runtime
registration
Runtime
registration
is
less
-
often
used
but
can
be
done
using
the
category
manager
'
s
XPCOM
API
:
js
Services
.
catMan
.
addCategoryEntry
(
"
browser
-
idle
-
startup
"
"
moz
-
src
:
/
/
browser
/
components
/
tabbrowser
/
TabUnloader
.
sys
.
mjs
"
"
TabUnloader
.
init
"
)

#
Publishers
/
actors
invoking
consumers
Publishers
call
BrowserUtils
.
callModulesFromCategory
with
a
dictionary
of
options
as
the
first
argument
.
If
provided
any
other
arguments
are
passed
straight
through
to
any
consumers
.
{
js
:
autofunction
}
BrowserUtils
.
callModulesFromCategory
Example
:
js
BrowserUtils
.
callModulesFromCategory
(
{
categoryName
:
"
my
-
fancy
-
category
-
name
"
profilerMarker
:
"
markMyCategories
"
idleDispatch
:
true
someArgument
}
)
;
This
will
pass
someArgument
to
each
consumer
registered
for
my
-
fancy
-
category
-
name
.
Each
consumer
will
be
invoked
via
an
idle
task
and
each
task
will
get
a
profiler
marker
(
labelled
"
markMyCategories
"
)
in
the
[
Firefox
Profiler
]
(
https
:
/
/
profiler
.
firefox
.
com
/
)
so
it
'
s
easy
to
find
in
performance
profiles
.
You
should
consider
using
idleDispatch
:
true
if
invocation
of
the
consumers
does
not
need
to
happen
synchronously
.
If
you
need
to
care
about
errors
produced
by
consumers
you
can
specify
a
function
for
failureHandler
and
handle
any
exceptions
/
errors
using
your
own
logic
.
Note
that
it
may
be
invoked
asynchronously
if
the
consumers
are
async
.
#
#
Caveats
Any
errors
thrown
by
consumers
are
automatically
caught
and
reported
via
the
[
Browser
Console
]
(
/
devtools
-
user
/
browser_console
/
index
.
rst
)
.
Async
functions
are
not
awaited
before
invoking
other
consumers
.
Note
that
rejections
(
exceptions
from
async
code
)
are
still
caught
and
reported
to
the
console
and
that
the
async
duration
of
a
given
consumer
will
be
what
determines
the
length
of
the
profiler
marker
if
the
publisher
asks
for
profiler
markers
.
#
#
Why
not
just
call
consumers
directly
?
There
are
a
number
of
benefits
over
direct
method
calls
and
module
imports
.
#
#
#
Reducing
direct
dependencies
between
different
parts
of
the
code
-
base
Code
that
looks
like
this
:
Foo
.
thingHappened
(
arg
)
;
Bar
.
thingHappened
(
arg
)
;
Baz
.
thingHappened
(
arg
)
;
is
not
only
repetitive
it
also
means
that
the
code
in
question
has
to
directly
import
all
the
modules
that
provide
Foo
Bar
and
Baz
.
It
means
that
if
those
modules
change
or
move
or
are
refactored
the
"
publisher
"
code
has
to
be
updated
with
all
the
added
burdens
that
comes
with
(
potential
for
merge
conflicts
more
automatically
added
reviewer
groups
for
trivial
changes
easy
to
miss
if
dependencies
are
widespread
)
.
#
#
#
Avoiding
a
bootstrap
problem
in
favour
of
a
"
just
in
time
"
approach
To
make
sure
code
is
invoked
later
when
using
the
observer
service
DOM
event
listeners
or
other
mechanisms
it
usually
needs
to
add
a
listener
before
the
event
of
interest
happens
.
If
not
managed
carefully
this
often
leads
to
component
initialization
being
front
-
loaded
to
make
sure
not
to
"
miss
"
it
later
.
This
in
turn
makes
browser
startup
more
heavyweight
rather
than
it
needs
to
be
because
we
set
up
listeners
for
_everything_
potentially
loading
entire
JS
modules
just
to
do
that
.
#
#
#
Unified
error
-
handling
performance
inspection
and
scheduling
Using
the
BrowserUtils
.
callModulesFromCategory
API
allows
specifying
error
handling
performance
profiler
markers
and
scheduling
(
use
of
idle
tasks
)
in
one
place
.
This
abstracts
away
the
fact
that
we
never
want
observers
event
listeners
or
other
mechanisms
like
this
to
break
and
stop
notifying
(
or
worse
propagate
an
exception
themselves
)
when
one
of
the
consumers
breaks
.
