Browser
Startup
#
#
Invoking
your
code
on
browser
startup
The
first
rule
of
running
code
during
startup
is
:
don
'
t
.
We
take
performance
very
seriously
and
ideally
your
component
/
feature
should
initialize
only
when
needed
.
If
you
have
established
that
you
really
must
run
code
during
startup
available
entrypoints
are
:
-
registering
a
browser
-
idle
-
startup
category
entry
for
your
JS
module
(
or
even
a
"
best
effort
"
user
idle
task
see
BrowserGlue
.
sys
.
mjs
)
-
registering
a
browser
-
window
-
delayed
-
startup
category
entry
for
your
JS
module
.
*
*
Note
that
this
is
invoked
for
each
browser
window
.
*
*
-
registering
a
browser
-
before
-
ui
-
startup
category
entry
if
you
really
really
need
to
.
This
will
run
code
before
the
first
browser
window
appears
on
the
screen
and
make
Firefox
seem
slow
so
please
don
'
t
do
it
unless
absolutely
necessary
.
See
[
the
category
manager
indirection
docs
]
(
.
/
CategoryManagerIndirection
.
md
)
for
more
details
on
this
.
Other
useful
points
in
startup
are
:
-
BrowserGlue
'
s
_onFirstWindowLoaded
(
which
should
be
converted
to
use
a
category
manager
call
instead
)
which
fires
after
the
first
browser
window
'
s
browser
-
window
-
delayed
-
startup
call
(
see
above
)
.
-
BrowserGlue
'
s
_scheduleBestEffortUserIdleTasks
as
mentioned
above
.
Note
that
in
this
case
your
code
*
*
may
not
run
at
all
*
*
if
the
browser
is
shut
down
quickly
.
-
BrowserGlue
'
s
_onWindowsRestored
and
/
or
the
observer
service
'
s
sessionstore
-
windows
-
restored
topic
and
/
or
a
category
manager
call
that
should
replace
the
BrowserGlue
list
of
direct
calls
.
This
fires
after
session
restore
has
completed
restoring
all
windows
(
but
before
all
pages
that
may
have
been
restored
have
necessarily
loaded
)
.
Note
that
this
is
guaranteed
to
fire
even
if
automatic
session
restore
is
not
enabled
.

How
do
first
run
/
first
startup
experiments
work
?
Why
does
synchronously
reading
Nimbus
feature
values
work
for
customizing
display
features
like
about
:
welcome
onboarding
and
the
default
browser
prompt
?
The
key
invariant
is
that
the
display
decisions
wait
for
sessionstore
-
windows
-
restored
to
show
customizable
UI
and
therefore
we
just
need
Nimbus
available
to
read
at
that
point
.
This
is
arranged
either
via
the
-
-
first
-
startup
flag
;
or
for
subsequent
startups
the
relevant
Nimbus
features
being
marked
isEarlyStartup
:
true
.
When
isEarlyStartup
:
true
Nimbus
caches
all
its
feature
variables
as
Gecko
preferences
ready
to
be
read
during
early
startup
.
(

early

Customizable
display
features
like
about
:
welcome
or
the
default
browser
prompt
are
used
in
[
_maybeShowDefaultBrowserPrompt

]

which
is
invoked
as
part
of
a
startup
idle
task
.
Startup

tasks
are
[
scheduled

.
Now
why
is
sessionstore
-
windows
-
restored
late
enough
for
a
first
startup
experiment
?
The
answer
is
subtle
.
During
Firefox
launch
[
final
-
ui
-
startup
is
notified
]
(

/

/

/
nsAppRunner

cpp
#

-
5765
)
and
in
response
SessionStore
is
initialized
.
Additionally
Nimbus
/
Normandy
initialization
is
[
started
but
not
awaited
]

.
Then
the
[

is
handled

.
When

-
first
-
startup
is
passed
we
[
spin
the
event
loop
to
allow
Nimbus
/
Normandy
time
to
complete
its

and

fetch

creating

Making
this
deterministic
is
tracked
by

.
Together
this
means
that
first
-
startup
experiments
will
be
loaded
in
time
to
impact
display
features
such
as
about
:
welcome
and
the
default
browser
prompt
and
we
should
not
have
a
"
split

"
scenario
in
which
the
Nimbus
feature
is
intermittently
unavailable
to
the
relevant
display
features
.
