For
historical
reasons
the
current
(
but
soon
-
to
-
be
legacy
)
Messaging

Onboarding
telemetry
documentation
is
mixed
in
with
the
Activity
Stream
documentation
.
All
except
the
main
documentation
is
at

Adding
or
changing
telemetry
For
now
do
the
same
stuff
we
'
ve
always
done
in
OMC
:
follow
the
[
process
in
the
Activity
Stream
telemetry
document
]
(
/
browser
/
components
/
newtab
/
docs
/
v2
-
system
-
addon
/
telemetry
.
md
)
with
one
exception
:
avoid
adding
any
new
nested
objects
as
these
end
up
being
flattened
or
stringified
before
being
sent
to
glean
.
Note
that
when
you
need
to
add
new
metrics
(
i
.
e
.
JSON
keys
)
they
MUST
to
be
[
added

Monitoring

Health
The
OMC
team
owns
an
[
OpMon
]
(
https
:
/

)
dashboard
for
the
FxMS
Desktop
Glean
telemetry
with
alerts
.
Note
that
it
can
only
show
one
channel
at
any
given
time
here
'
s
a
link
to
[
Windows

and
reading
the

can
help
clarify
exactly
what
it
means
.
We
are
the
owner
of
this
file
and
are
encouraged
to
adjust
it
to
our
needs
though
it
'
s
probably
a
good
idea
to
get
review
from
someone
in
Data
Science
.
The
current
plan
is
to
review
the
OpMon
dashboard
as
a
group
in
our
weekly
triage
meeting
note
anything
that
seems
unusual
to
our

The
dashboard
is
configured
to
alert
in
various
cases
and
those
alerts
can
be
seen
at
the
bottom
of
the
dashboard

As
of
this
writing
the
alerts
have
some
noise
[

be
cleaned
up

You
define
metrics
like
counts
and
timings
and
things
and
package
those
into
pings
which
are
the
payloads
sent
to
our
servers
