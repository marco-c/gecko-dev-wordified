Only
used
for
telemetry
specific
to
restoring
a
profile
from
a
backup
.
This
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
we
can
unconditionally
send
it
immediately
when
we
complete
the
restore
since
if
we
don
'
t
that
profile
may
never
be
launched
again
and
then
the
telemetry
would
be
lost
.
Note
that
this
only
contains
specifically
the
probes
that
have
this
requirement
.
Any
telemetry
that
is
intended
to
be
gathered
regularly
or
telemetry
that
is
intended
to
be
gathered
in
the
new
(

)
profile
will
not
be
in
