Storybook
for
Firefox
Storybook
is
a
component
library
to
document
our
design
system
reusable
components
and
any
specific
components
you
might
want
to
test
with
dummy
data
.
=
=
Background
The
storybook
will
list
components
that
can
be
reused
and
will
help
document
what
common
elements
we
have
.
It
can
also
list
implementation
specific
components
but
they
should
not
be
added
to
the
"
Design
System
"
section
.
Changes
to
files
directly
referenced
from
the
storybook
(
so
basically
non
-
chrome
:
/
/
paths
)
should
automatically
reflect
changes
in
the
opened
browser
.
If
you
make
a
change
to
a
chrome
:
/
/
referenced
file
then
you
'
ll
need
to
do
a
hard
refresh
(
Cmd
+
Shift
+
R
/
Ctrl
+
Shift
+
R
)
to
notice
the
changes
.
Currently
Windows
is
only
supported
through
WSL
/
Linux
VM
.

Running
Storybook
Installing
the
npm
dependencies
and
running
the
storybook
npm
script
should
be
enough
to
get
storybook
running
.
This
can
be
done
with
your
personal
npm
/
node
that
happens
to
be
compatible
or
using
.
/
mach
npm
.

=
Running
with
mach
based
npm
If
you
do
this
a
lot
you
might
want
to
add
an
alias
like
this
to
your
shell
'
s
startup
config
:
alias
npm
-
storybook
=
"
.
/
mach
npm
-
-
prefix
=
browser
/
components
/
storybook
"
Then
running
npm
-
storybook
from
the
repo
'
s
root
directory
will
work
with
the
storybook
directory
.
To
start
storybook
the
first
time
(
or
if
it
'
s
been
a
while
since
you
last
installed
)

you
can
skip

You
can
use
