Finding
a
Figma
component
to
generate
the
initial
Code
Connect
file
After
installing
and
setting
your
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN
in
your
terminal
you
will
need
to
navigate
to
our
Figma
library
to
find
a
component
that
needs
a
Code
Connect
config
file
.
You
can
find
a
potential
component
through
various
ways
:
1
.
Searching
through

section
.
*
*
Note
:
*
*
Not
all
Figma
components
will
need
a
Code

config
.
For
example
the

exists
as
a
standalone

but
it
is
only
used
as
a
subcomponent
for
the

which
more
accurately
models
our

.
Once
you
are
aware
of
the
Figma
component
you
want
to
work
on
you
'
ll
need
to
navigate
to
Figma
and
find
the
base
Figma
component
.
It
should
have
an
icon
of
a
diamond
made
of
four
smaller
diamonds
.
When
you
select
this
component
it
likely
will
say
*
*
Component

*
*
in
the
sidebar
.

Ensure
that
you
have
selected
the
main
Figma
component
instead
of
an
instance
of
it
.
Code
Connect
will
not
setup
correctly
for
an
instance
.
There
should
be
an
option
indicated
by
either
a
diamond
with
four
smaller
diamonds
or
a
diamond
with
an
arrow
pointing
out
from
the
diamond
.
This
icon
button
is
used
to
go
to
the
main
component
and
will
be
labelled
"
Go
to
main
component
"
once
you
hover
on
the
icon
button
.
Use
this
"
Go
to
main
component
"
button
to
check
if
there
is
a
component
set
higher
up
in
the
hierarchy
.
Once
you
'
ve
got
the
main
component
set
then
you
can
copy
a
link
to
the
component
and
move
to
generating

Generating
the
initial
Code
Connect
file
for
a
Figma
component
After
finding
the
main
component
set
in
the
previous
step
and
copying
the
link
to
the
main
component
navigate
to
your
Firefox
repo
in
your
terminal
and
then
navigate
to
toolkit
/
content
/
widgets
.
To
simplify
development
we
will
create
the
initial
config
file
in
toolkit
/
content
/
widgets
by
running
the
following
command
(
please
note
the
single
quotes
are
needed
to
correctly
parse
the
URL
!
)
:
npx
figma
connect
create
'
<
main
component
set
link
>
'
For
example
this
command
would
look
something
like
npx
figma
connect
create
'
https
:
/
/
www
.
figma
.
com
/
design
/
[
.
.
.
]
?
node
-
id
=
1
-
255
'
where
the
full
URL
is
the
GUID
for
your
design
document
.
This
command
will
work
regardless
if
you
copied
the
link
in
Dev
Mode
(
which
has
an
additional
query
&
m
=
dev
at
the
end
of
the
link
)
or
not
.
If
the
Code
Connect
tool
was
able
to
find
a
component
in
that
copied
URL
you
will
receive
the
following
output
in
your
terminal
:

.
ts
If
the
Code
Connect
tool
was
not
able
to
find
a
component
it
will
throw
an
error
and
notify
you
in
your
terminal
output
.
The
most
common
reason
for
this
error
is
the
particular
node
or
layer
you
used
for
the
linked
URL
is
not
actually
a
component
but
a
wrapper
for
one
or
more
components
.
Try
navigating
a
layer
above
or
below
the
node
you
used
and
see
if
you
are
able
to
generate
a
Code
Connect
config
file
using
one
of
those
other
nodes
.
#
#
#
Modifying
the
generated
config
file
While
generating
the
file
is
a
good
start
you
will
need
to
move
it
rename
it
and
modify
it
.
You
should
move
this
generated
file
to
the
component
specific
folder
and
rename
it
to
<
component
-
name
>
.
figma
.
ts
.
The
generator
names
the
file
according
to
the
Figma
component
so
this
may
not
have
the
same
name
as
the
Lit
component
.
For
example
the
generator
creates
a
file
titled
checkbox
.
figma
.
ts
.
This
file
should
be
moved
to
the
corresponding
folder
-
in
this
case
/
toolkit
/
content
/
widgets
/
moz
-
checkbox
-
and
renamed
to
moz
-
checkbox
.
figma
.
ts
.
The
goal
of
this
config
is
to
create
a
mapping
between
what
properties
the
Lit
component
takes
and
what
properties
are
defined
in
Figma
which
are
reflected
in
the
props
object
.
The
values
within
the
props
object
will
be
used
in
generating
the
Code
Connect
snippet
.
javascript
{
props
:
{
showIcon
:
figma
.
boolean
(
"
Show

"
{
true

}
)

}
example
:
props

{
props

}
iconsrc

This
appears
as

"
>

}
*
*
Note
:
*
*
The
generated
props
object
may
not
capture
all
of
the
properties
that
can
or
should
be
mapped
from
Figma
.
#
#
#
#
When
the

The
value

(
propertyName
)
"
code
"
will
be
the
expected
value
from
a
given
instance
of
a
Figma
component
.
So
if
it
is
the
checked
boolean
in
Figma
that
value
will
be
set
to
true
when
the
instance
in
Figma
has
it
set
to
true
.
javascript
checked
:
figma
.
boolean
(
"
Checked

)
#
#
#
#
When
the
property
types
are
different
You
can
work
around
a
type
difference
by
providing
an
object
to
the
figma
[
type
]
call
this
will
be
used
to
match
the
value
that
the
Figma
property
is
set
to
and
map
it
to
a
value
for
the
Lit
property
.
javascript
/
/
Figma
State
=
IsChecked
will
set
checked
:
true
checked
:
figma
.
Enum
(
"

"

"
{
true
:

chrome

"
false

}
)
For

If
you
are
interacting

Mapping
Figma
props
back
to
Lit
props
You
may
encounter
cases
where
in
Figma
you
can
toggle
some
configuration
of
a
component
.
For
example
given
[

&
m

)
we
can
toggle
a
description
a
support
link
and
an
icon
.
When
activating
the
"
Show
description
"
and
"
Show
support
link
"
toggles
we
get
two
new
editable
text
fields
"
Description
"
and
"
Support
link
"
.
To
ensure
the
generated
code
snippet
shows
the
correct
value
for
these
fields
we
have
to
map
a
Figma
boolean
to
return
a
string
when
the
boolean
is
true
:
javascript
props
:
{
description
:

boolean
(
"
Show

{
true

}
)

:
figma
.
boolean
(
"
Show

"
{
true
:
"
sumo

"
}
)
}
In
the
"
Description
"
case
we
use
figma
.
string
(
"
Description
"
)
so
that
the
generated
snippet
will
show
the
current
value
in
the
"
Description
"
text
field
.
We
don
'
t
do
this
for
the
"
Support

"
case
though
since
the
way
to
get
the
correct
generated
support
link
element
is
by
passing
a
SUMO

to

Working
with
nested
props
and
nested
components
You
'
ll
notice
that
the
actual
moz
-
checkbox
config
file
has
a
relatively
large
props
object
with
two
additional
props
objects
called
labelProps
and
checkboxProps
.
This
is
due
to
how
the
component
is
set
up
in
Figma
as
the
main
component
is
a
wrapper
called
[
"
Checkbox
with
label
"
]
(

node
-
id
=

-

&
m
=
dev
)
.
This
component
consists
of
two
components
"
Checkbox
"
and
"
Label
"
so
we
'
ll
use
these
component
names
for
our
nested
props
:
javascript
props
:
{
/
/
labelProps
is
intentionally
omitted
for
simplicity
labelProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Label
"
.
.
.
)
checkboxProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Checkbox
"
.
.
.
)
}
This
allows
us
to
take
our
previously
defined
"
Checkbox
"
props
and
reference
them
through
checkboxProps
which
will
be
required
for
the
updated
example
template
:
javascript
props
:
{
/
/
labelProps
is
intentionally
omitted
for
simplicity
labelProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Label
"
.
.
.
)
checkboxProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Checkbox
"
{
checked
:
figma
.
boolean
(
"
Checked
"
)
disabled
:
figma
.
enum
(
"
State
"
{
Disabled
:
true
}
)
}
)
}
Once
we
add
these
nested
references
to
our
example
template
then
changing
these
properties
in
Figma
will
cause
the
generated
code
snippet
to
be
updated
accordingly
:
javascript
props
:
{
/
/
labelProps
is
intentionally
omitted
for
simplicity
labelProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Label
"
.
.

)
checkboxProps
:
figma
.
nestedProps
(
"
Checkbox
"
{
checked

boolean
(
"

"
)
disabled
:
figma
.
enum
(
"
State
"
{
Disabled
:
true
}
)
}
)

Don
'
t
use
conditional
statements
in
the
example
template
The
example
template
does
not
allow
conditional
statements
.
Any
logic
should
be
handled
through
the
props
object
.
javascript
/
/
In
this
component
an
icon
should
only
render
if
there
is
a
label
/
/
The
following
example
is
invalid
html
<
moz
-
component
label
=
{
props
.
label
}
iconsrc
=
{
props
.
label
?
props
.
iconSrc
:
undefined
}
>
<
/
moz
-
component
>
/
/
Instead
set
up
the
figma
[
type
]
statements
like
this
label
:
figma
.
string
(
"
Label
"
)
iconSrc
:
figma
.
boolean
(
"
Show
label
"
{
true
:
"
chrome
:
/
/
example
.
svg
"
false
:
undefined
}
)
/
/
Then
create
the
example
template
as
normal
html
<
moz
-
component
label
=
{
props
.
label
}
iconsrc
=
{
props

iconSrc
}

Match

case
of
what
is
present
in
Figma
Ensure
that
the
names
of
any
components
nested
components
and
properties
that
you
use
in
the
Code
Connect
file
matches
the
name
used
in
the
Figma
file
.
For
example
if
a
Figma
property
is
named
sHoW
dEsCrIpTiOn
(
not
that
anyone
would
do
that
)
it
will
not
map
correctly
if
it
is
referred
to
as
"

in
the
config
file
.

What
if
something
in
Figma
doesn
'
t
map
back
to
anything
in
the
implemented
component
?
Sometimes
that
'
s
okay
!
Some
props
will
not
map
back
to
code
and
may
be
there
to
make
using
Figma
easier
.
For
example
many
of
the
options
under
the
"
State
"
select
for
a
component
do
not
get
mapped
to
code
.
Using
the
"
Checkbox
with
label
"
Figma
component
as
an
example
again
there
are
various
options
for
State
:
-
Default
-
Hover
-
Active
-
Focus
-
Disabled
There
'
s
nothing
we
have
to
pass
to
<
moz
-
checkbox
>
for
it
to
appear
in
a
"
Default
"
state
so
we
do
not
need
to
map
this
.
"
Hover
"
"
Active
"
and
"
Focus
"
are
all
CSS
pseudo
-
classes
that
are
handled
by
the
code
implementation
we
don
'
t
have
to
pass
any
additional
props
for
these
states
to
behave
as
expected
.
This
leaves
us
with
"
Disabled
"
which
is
something
that
can
be
controlled
through
a
property
/
attribute
therefore
we
want
to
make
sure
this
attribute
appears
in
the
generated
snippet
when
a
Figma
user
selects
"
Disabled
"
in
the
dropdown
.
javascript
props
:
{
disabled
:
figma
.
enum
(
"
State
"
{
Disabled
:
true
}
)
}
Other
times
this
could
be
a
sign
that
there
'
s
a
deviation
in
the
design
or
the
implemented
component
.
Maybe
it
'
s
a
feature
that
hasn
'
t
been
implemented
yet
and
so
we
don
'
t
want
to
show
any
code
snippets
when
that
feature
is
enabled
in
Figma
.
It
could
be
something
that
was
missed
when
previously
creating
the
Code
Connect
config
for
a
particular
component
there
could
be
a
variety
of
reasons
.
It
may
be
worth
reaching
out
to
design
to
make
sure
the
implemented
component
and
the
design
component
are
not
deviating
from
each
other
.

An

In

we
are

change
the

and
action

label
through
the
Fluent

.
This
mostly
maps
to
the
properties
in
the
Figma
component
however
we
can
only
update
the
action

label
through
the
nested
Button
component
.
Additionally
we
generally
do
not
include
l10n
properties
in
the
Code
Connect
example
snippets
.
As
the
nested
Button
'
s
properties
are
not
currently
exposed
on
the
top
level
of
the

we
are
not
able
