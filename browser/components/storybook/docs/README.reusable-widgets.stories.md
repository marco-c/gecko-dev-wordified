Reusable

Background
Different
Firefox
surfaces
make
use
of
similar
UI
elements
such
as
cards
menus
toggles
and
message
bars
.
A
group
of
designers
and
developers
have
started
working
together
to
create
standardized
versions
of
these
elements
in
the
form
of
new
web
components
.
The
intention
is
for
these
components
to
encapsulate
our
design
system
ensure
accessibility
and
usability
across
the
application
and
reduce
the
maintenance
burden
associated
with
supporting
multiple
different
implementations
of
the
same
UI
patterns
.
Many
of
these
components
are
being
built
using
the
[
Lit
library
]
(
https
:
/
/
lit
.
dev
/
)
to
take
advantage
of
its
templating
syntax
and
re
-
rendering
logic
.
All
new
components
are
being
documented
in
Storybook
in
an
effort
to
create
a
catalog
that
engineers
and
designers
can
use
to
see
which
components
can
be
easily
lifted
off
the
shelf
for
use
throughout
Firefox
.

Adding
new
design
system
components
We
have
a
.
/
mach
addwidget
scaffold
command
to
make
it
easier
to
create
new
reusable
components
and
hook
them
up
to
Storybook
.
Currently
this
command
can
only
be
used
to
add
a
new
Lit
based
web
component
to
toolkit
/
content
/
widgets
.
In
the
future
we
may
expand
it
to
support
options
for
creating
components
without
using
Lit
and
for
adding
components
to
different
directories
.
To
create
a
new
component
you
run
:
sh
#
Component
names
should
be
in
kebab
-
case
and
contain
at
least
1
-
.
.
/
mach
addwidget
component
-
name
The
scaffold
command
will
generate
the
following
files
:
sh
toolkit
content
tests
widgets
test_component_name
.
html
#
chrome
test
widgets
component

#
new

.

#
Lit
based

.
stories
.
mjs
#
component

It
will
also
make
modifications
to
toolkit
/
content
/
jar
.
mn
to
add
chrome
:
/
/
URLs
for
the
new
files
and
to
toolkit
/
content
/
tests
/
widgets
/
chrome
.
ini
to
enable
running
the
newly
added
test
.
After
running
the
scaffold
command
you
can
start
Storybook
and
you
will
see
placeholder
content
that
has
been
generated
for
your
component
.
You
can
then
start
altering
the
generated
files
and
see
your
changes
reflected
in
Storybook
.
Unfortunately
for
now
the
[
browser_all_files_referenced
.
js
]
(
https
:
/
/

.

/

/

browser_all_files_referenced
.
js
)
test
will
fail
unless
your
new
component
is
immediately
used
somewhere
outside
of
Storybook
.
We
have
plans
to
fix
this
issue
but
for
now
you
can
get
around
it
by
updating
[

Using
new
components
Once
you
'
ve
added
a
new
component
to
toolkit
/
content
/
widgets
and
created
chrome
:
/
/
URLs
via
toolkit
/
content
/
jar
.
mn
you
should
be
able
to
start
using
it
throughout
Firefox
.
You
can
import
the
component
into
html
/
xhtml
files
via
a
script
tag
with
type
=
"
module
"
:

<

Common
pitfalls
If
you
'
re
trying
to
use
a
reusable
component
but
nothing
is
appearing
on
the
page
it
may
be
due
to
one
of
the
following
issues
:
-
Omitting
the
type
=
"
module
"
in
your
script
tag
.
-
Not
specifying
the
html
:
namespace
when
using
a
custom
HTML
element
in
an
xhtml
file
.
For
example
the
tag
should
look
something
like
this
:
html
<
html
:
your
-
component
-
name
>
<
/
html
:
your
-
component
-
name
>
-
Adding
a
script
tag
to
an
inc
.
xhtml
file
.
For
example
when
using
a
new
component
in
the
privacy
section
of
about
:
preferences
the
script
tag
needs
to
be
added
to
preferences
.
xhtml
rather
than
to
privacy
.
inc
.
xhtml
.
-
Trying
to
extend
a
built
-
in
HTML
element
in
Lit
.
Because
Webkit
never
implemented
support
for
customized
built
-
ins
Lit
doesn
'
t
support
it
either
.
That
means
if
you
want
to
do
something
like
:
js
customElements
.
define
(
"
cool
-
button
"
CoolButton
{
extends
:
"
button
"
}
)
;
you
will
need
to
make
a
vanilla
custom
element
you
cannot
use
Lit
.

this

practice
