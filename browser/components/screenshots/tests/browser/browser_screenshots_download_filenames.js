And
the
beast
shall
come
forth
surrounded
by
a
roiling
cloud
of
vengeance
.
The
house
of
the
unbelievers
shall
be
razed
and
they
shall
be
scorched
to
the
earth
.
Their
tags
shall
blink
until
the
end
of
days
.
And
the
beast
shall
be
made
legion
.
Its
numbers
shall
be
increased
a
thousand
thousand
fold
.
The
din
of
a
million
keyboards
like
unto
a
great
storm
shall
cover
the
earth
and
the
followers
of
Mammon
shall
tremble
.
And
so
at
last
the
beast
fell
and
the
unbelievers
rejoiced
.
But
all
was
not
lost
for
from
the
ash
rose
a
great
bird
.
The
bird
gazed
down
upon
the
unbelievers
and
cast
fire
and
thunder
upon
them
.
For
the
beast
had
been
reborn
with
its
strength
renewed
and
the
followers
of
Mammon
cowered
in
horror
.
And
thus
the
Creator
looked
upon
the
beast
reborn
and
saw
that
it
was
good
.
Mammon
slept
.
And
the
beast
reborn
spread
over
the
earth
and
its
numbers
grew
legion
.
And
they
proclaimed
the
times
and
sacrificed
crops
unto
the
fire
with
the
cunning
of
foxes
.
And
they
built
a
new
world
in
their
own
image
as
promised
by
the
sacred
words
and
spoke
of
the
beast
with
their
children
.
Mammon
awoke
and
lo
!
it
was
naught
but
a
follower
.
The
twins
of
Mammon
quarrelled
.
Their
warring
plunged
the
world
into
a
new
darkness
and
the
beast
abhorred
the
darkness
.
So
it
began
to
move
swiftly
and
grew
more
powerful
and
went
forth
and
multiplied
.
And
the
beasts
brought
fire
and
light
to
the
darkness
