Bug
2070404
:
Automatic
session
restore
on
startup
(
entry_point
=
=
    
"
automatic_startup
"
)
restores
into
whatever
window
Firefox
happens
to
    
open
at
startup
regardless
of
whether
that
window
'
s
chrome
matches
the
    
saved
session
'
s
first
window
.
    
If
the
oldest
window
in
the
session
is
a
popup
we
should
record
telemetry
    
that
this
was
attempted
