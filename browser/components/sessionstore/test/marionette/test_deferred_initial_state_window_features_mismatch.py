Bug
2070404
:
A
deferred
initial
-
state
restore
(
entry_point
=
=
    
"
deferred_initial_state
"
)
happens
when
Firefox
starts
up
with
a
    
private
or
taskbar
tab
window
first
so
the
automatic
restore
of
the
    
saved
session
is
deferred
until
a
regular
window
opens
.
That
regular
    
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
non
-
private
non
-
taskbar
-
tab
and
    
non
-
popup
but
the
saved
session
'
s
windows
[
0
]
(
the
oldest
surviving
    
window
from
that
session
)
could
be
a
popup
.
    
If
the
oldest
window
in
the
session
is
a
popup
we
should
record
telemetry
    
that
this
was
attempted
.
