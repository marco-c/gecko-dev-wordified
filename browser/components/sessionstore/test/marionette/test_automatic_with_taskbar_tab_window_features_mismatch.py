Bug
2070404
:
When
the
last
regular
Firefox
window
closes
while
a
    
taskbar
tab
window
remains
open
SessionStore
saves
the
current
state
    
so
it
can
be
restored
automatically
(
entry_point
=
=
    
"
automatic_with_taskbar_tab
"
)
the
next
time
a
regular
window
opens
.
    
Taskbar
tab
windows
are
excluded
from
that
saved
state
but
popup
    
windows
are
not
.
If
the
closing
"
last
regular
window
"
was
a
    
popup
it
ends
up
as
windows
[
0
]
of
the
saved
state
and
a
later
    
regular
window
can
'
t
be
turned
into
a
popup
to
match
it
.
    
If
the
oldest
window
in
the
session
is
a
popup
we
should
record
telemetry
    
that
this
was
attempted
.
