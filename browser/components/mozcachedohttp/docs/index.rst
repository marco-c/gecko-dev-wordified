Overview

=
=
=
The
moz
-
cached
-
ohttp
protocol
implements
a
cache
-
first
strategy
that
:
1
.
First
attempts
to
load
resources
from
the
HTTP
cache
to
minimize
OHTTP
requests
2
.
Falls
back
to
loading
via
OHTTP
when
resources
are
not
available
in
cache
3
.
Automatically
caches
OHTTP
responses
for
future
requests
4
.
Respects
HTTP
cache
expiration
headers
for
proper
cache
management
but
otherwise
defaults
to
24
hours
for
the
cache
expiry
.

The

uses
a

format
to
encode
the
target
resource
URL
:
.

code
-

note
:
:
Only
the

The

will
be
used
for
the

note
:
:
The
OHTTP
Relay
and
Gateway
must
both
be
configured
to
enable
requests
.
The
OHTTP
Gateway
also
needs
to
have
an
allowlist
that
includes
the
resource
endpoint
otherwise
requests
are
likely
to
return
403
Forbidden
responses

The
protocol
uses
a
host
-
based
configuration
system
that
maps
URL
hosts
to
specific
OHTTP
settings
.
This
design
allows
different
types
of
resource
requests
to
use
different
OHTTP
configurations
in
the
future
.

Extensibility

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
The
host
-
based
design
allows
easy
addition
of
new
hosts
with
different
OHTTP
configurations
:
.
.
code
-
block
:
:
javascript
/
/
Future
hosts
could
be
added
like
:
/
/
moz
-
cached
-
ohttp
:
/
/
other
-
service
/
?
url
=
<
encoded
-
url
>
/
/
moz
-
cached
-
ohttp
:
/
/
ads
-
service
/
?
url
=
<
encoded
-
url
>
Each
host
would
map
to
its
own
set
of
configuration
preferences
allowing
different
services
to
use
different
OHTTP
infrastructure
.
