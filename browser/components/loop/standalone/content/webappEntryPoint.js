When
processed
by
webpack
this
file
bundles
up
all
the
JS
for
the
/
/
standalone
client
.
/
/
/
/
When
loaded
by
the
development
server
index
.
html
supplies
a
require
/
/
function
to
load
these
.
/
/
Right
now
these
are
manually
ordered
so
that
all
dependencies
are
/
/
satisfied
.
Before
long
we
'
d
like
to
convert
these
into
real
modules
/
/
and
/
or
better
shims
and
push
the
dependencies
down
into
the
modules
/
/
themselves
so
that
this
manual
management
step
goes
away
.
/
/
To
get
started
we
'
re
using
webpack
'
s
script
loader
to
load
these
things
in
/
/
as
-
is
.
/
*
global
require
*
/
/
/
The
OpenTok
SDK
tries
to
do
some
heuristic
detection
of
require
and
/
/
assumes
a
node
environment
if
it
'
s
present
which
confuses
webpack
so
/
/
we
turn
that
off
by
forcing
require
to
false
in
that
context
.
require
(
"
imports
?
require
=
>
false
!
shared
/
libs
/
sdk
.
js
"
)
;
require
(
"
script
!
.
/
libs
/

)
;

Ultimately
we
'
ll
likely
want
to
pull
the
vendor
libraries
from
npm
as
that
/
/
makes
upgrading
easier
and
it
'
s
generally
better
practice
to
minify
the
/
/
"
source
"
versions
of
libraries
rather
than
built
artifacts
.
We
probably
do
/
/
want
to
minify
them
ourselves
since
this
allows
for
better
dead
-
code
/
/
elimination
but
that
can
be
a
bit
of
judgement
call
.

Note
that
anything
that
uses
the
script
loader
doesn
'
t
get
minified
so
/
/
these
need
to
be
shimmed
to
use
to
other
loaders
(
easiest
first
cut
)
