When
processed
by
webpack
this
file
bundles
up
all
the
JS
for
the
/
/
standalone
client
.
/
/
/
/
When
loaded
by
the
development
server
index
.
html
supplies
a
require
/
/
function
to
load
these
.
/
/
Right
now
these
are
manually
ordered
so
that
all
dependencies
are
/
/
satisfied
.
Before
long
we
'
d
like
to
convert
these
into
real
modules
/
/
and
/
or
better
shims
and
push
the
dependencies
down
into
the
modules
/
/
themselves
so
that
this
manual
management
step
goes
away
.
/
/
To
get
started
we
'
re
using
webpack
'
s
script
loader
to
load
these
things
in
/
/
as
-
is
.
/
*
global
require
*
/
/
/
The
OpenTok
SDK
tries
to
do
some
heuristic
detection
of
require
and
/
/
assumes
a
node
environment
if
it
'
s
present
which
confuses
webpack
so
/
/
we
turn
that
off
by
forcing
require
to
false
in
that
context
.
require
(
"
imports
?
require
=
>
false
!
shared
/
libs
/
sdk
.
js
"
)
;
/
/
Ultimately
we
'
ll
likely
want
to
pull
the
vendor
libraries
from
npm
as
that
/
/
makes
upgrading
easier
and
it
'
s
generally
better
practice
to
minify
the
/
/
"
source
"
versions
of
libraries
rather
than
built
artifacts
.
We
probably
do
/
/
want
to
minify
them
ourselves
since
this
allows
for
better
dead
-
code
/
/
elimination
but
that
can
be
a
bit
of
judgement
call
.

Someday
these
will
be
real
modules
.
For
now
we
'
re
chaining
loaders
/
/
to
teach
webpack
how
to
treat
them
like
modules
anyway
.
/
/
/
/
We
do
it
in
this
file
rather
than
globally
in
webpack
.
config
.
js
/
/
because
:
/
/
/
/
*
it
'
s
easiest
to
understand
magic
(
like
loader
chaining
/
/
interactions
)
when
it
'
s
explicit
and
in
one
place
/
/
*
migrating
stuff
over
to
real
modules
is
easier
to
do
gradually
/
/
/
/
The
strategy
works
like
this
(
webpack
loaders
chain
from
right
to
left
)
:
/
/
/
/
In
standalone
loop
is
defined
for
the
first
time
in
index
.
html
.
/
/
/
/
The
exports
?
loop
loader
sets
up
webpack
to
ensure
that
exports
is
/
/
actually
exposed
to
outside
world
rather
than
held
privately
.
/
/
/
/
The
imports
=
?
loop
=
>
window
.
loop
loader
puts
the
existing
window
.
loop
/
/
reference
into
that
exported
container
for
further
modification
