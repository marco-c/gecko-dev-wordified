How
to
use
the
visual
regression
tool
Note
that
this
is
a
*
work
-
in
-
progress
*
;
watch
out
for
*
rough
edges
*
.
In
particular
it
can
generate
a
fair
number
of
false
positives
most
visually
fairly
obvious
.
That
said
for
CSS
rule
changes
that
may
effect
multiple
views
it
can
be
extremely
handy
for
detecting
subtle
regressions
.
It
works
by
taking
a
snapshot
of
each
view
in
the
ui
-
showcase
and
then
comparing
it
to
a
previous
version
of
the
same
snapshot
generating
an
image
which
shows
differences
between
the
two
.

diffs
have
the

image
on

the
diff
in
the
middle
and
the

new
image
on
right
all
joined
into
a
single
image
so
you
can
see
them
#
together
.
look
for
images
that
have
red
in
the
diff
section
to
find
potential
#
regressions
#
#
Note
Because
Selenium
launches
a
separate
browser
window
you
can
make
changes
to
the
CSS
or
markup
without
having
to
worry
that
it
will
affect
the
screenshots
.
You
can
generate
the
diffs
after
you
have
finished
your
changes
before
submitting
the
patch
.
