These
types
are
commonly
passed
as
parameters
with
the
Urlbar
code
.
We
/
/
define
them
here
to
avoid
having
to
import
them
into
each
module
.
/
/
TypeScript
will
still
warn
about
attempting
to
call
new
UrlbarController
(
)
/
/
and
similar
actions
because
these
are
only
defined
as
types
and
not
values
.
