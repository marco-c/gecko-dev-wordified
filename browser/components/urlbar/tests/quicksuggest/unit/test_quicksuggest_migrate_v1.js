It
'
s
unfortunate
that
sponsored
suggestions
are
ultimately
on
since
before
/
/
the
migration
no
suggestions
were
shown
to
the
user
.
There
'
s
nothing
we
can
/
/
do
about
it
aside
from
forcing
off
suggestions
in
more
cases
than
we
want
.
/
/
The
reason
is
that
at
the
time
of
migration
we
can
'
t
tell
that
the
previous
/
/
scenario
was
online
-
-
or
more
precisely
that
it
wasn
'
t
history
.
If
we
knew
/
/
it
wasn
'
t
history
then
we
'
d
know
to
turn
sponsored
off
;
if
we
knew
it
*
was
*
/
/
history
then
we
'
d
know
to
turn
sponsored
-
-
and
non
-
sponsored
-
-
on

/
/
the
scenario
at
the
time
of
migration
is
offline
where
suggestions
should
be
/
/
enabled
by
default
.
/
/
/
/
This
is
the
reason
we
now
record
quicksuggest
