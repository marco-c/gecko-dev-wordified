Tests
that
search
terms
don
'
t
persist
with
navigating
to
non
-
SERP
URIs
.
/
/
Normally
when
setURI
is
called
dependent
properties
for
persisted
search
/
/
like
originalURI
are
set
to
a
different
value
and
the
userTypedValue
is
/
/
nullified
.
But
we
should
ensure
that
if
setURI
receives
a
URI
with
a
/
/
different
origin
from
the
originalURI
search
terms
will
not
persist
