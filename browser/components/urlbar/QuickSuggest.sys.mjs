Important
notes
when
modifying
this
:
/
/
/
/
If
you
add
a
pref
to
one
scenario
you
typically
need
to
add
it
to
all
/
/
scenarios
even
if
the
pref
is
in
firefox
.
js
.
That
'
s
because
we
need
to
/
/
allow
for
switching
from
one
scenario
to
another
at
any
time
after
/
/
startup
.
If
we
set
a
pref
for
one
scenario
on
the
default
branch
we
/
/
switch
to
a
new
scenario
and
we
don
'
t
set
the
pref
for
the
new
scenario
/
/
it
will
keep
its
default
-
branch
value
from
the
old
scenario
.
The
only
/
/
possible
exception
is
for
prefs
that
make
others
unnecessary
like
how
/
/
when
quicksuggest
.
enabled
is
false
none
of
the
other
prefs
matter
.
/
/
/
/
Prefs
not
listed
here
for
any
scenario

their
values

If
you
are
modifying
this
method
keep
in
mind
that
setting
a
pref
/
/
that
'

will
trigger
the
pref
/
/
observer
inside
Nimbus
and
call
all
NimbusFeatures
.
urlbar
.
onUpdate
/
/
callbacks
.
Inside
this
class
we
guard
against
that
by
using
/
/
_updatingFirefoxSuggestScenario
.
/
/
/
/
The
scenario
-
update
process
is
described
next
.
/
/
/
/
1
.
Pick
a
scenario
which
depends
on
the
user
'
s
region
and
locale
.
/
/
/
/
2
.
Set
prefs
on
the
default
branch
appropriate
for
the
scenario
.
We
use
/
/
the
default
branch
and
not
the
user
branch
because
conceptually
each
/
/
scenario
has
a
default
behavior
which
we
want
to
distinguish
from
the
/
/
user
'
s
choices
.
/
/
/
/
In
particular
it
'
s
important
to
consider
prefs
that
are
exposed
in
the
/
/
UI
like
whether
sponsored
suggestions
are
enabled
.
Once
the
user
/
/
makes
a
choice
to
change
a
default
we
want
to
preserve
that
choice
/
/
indefinitely
regardless
of
the
scenario
the
user
is
currently
enrolled
/
/
in
or
future
scenarios
they
might
be
enrolled
in
.
User
choices
are
of
/
/
course
recorded
on
the
user
branch
so
if
we
set
scenario
defaults
on
/
/
the
user
branch
too
we
wouldn
'
t
be
able
to
distinguish
user
choices
/
/
from
default
values
.
This
is
also
why
prefs
that
are
exposed
in
the
UI
/
/
should
be
sticky
.
Unlike
non
-
sticky
prefs
sticky
prefs
retain
their
/
/
user
-
branch
values
even
when
those
values
are
the
same
as
the
ones
on
/
/
the
default
branch
.
/
/
/
/
It
'
s
important
to
note
that
the
defaults
we
set
here
do
not
persist
/
/
across
app
restarts
.
(
This
is
a
feature
of
the
pref
service
;
prefs
set
/
/
programmatically
on
the
default
branch
are
not
stored
anywhere
/
/
permanent
like
firefox
.
js
or
user
.
js
.
)
That
'
s
why
BrowserGlue
calls
/
/
init
(
)
on
every
startup
.
/
/
/
/
3
.
Some
prefs
are
both
exposed
in
the
UI
and
configurable
via
Nimbus
/
/
like
whether
data
collection
is
enabled
.
We
absolutely
want
to
/
/
preserve
the
user
'
s
past
choices
for
these
prefs
.
But
if
the
user
/
/
hasn
'
t
yet
made
a
choice
for
a
particular
pref
then
it
should
be
/
/
configurable
.
/
/
/
/
For
any
such
prefs
that
have
values
defined
in
Nimbus
we
set
their
/
/
default
-
branch
values
to
their
Nimbus
values
.
(
These
defaults
/
/
therefore
override
any
set
in
the
previous
step
.
)
If
a
pref
has
a
user
/
/
value
accessing
the
pref
will
return
the
user
value
;
if
it
does
not
/
/
have
a
user
value
accessing
it
will
return
the
value
that
was
/
/
specified
in
Nimbus
.
/
/
/
/
This
isn
'
t
strictly
necessary
.
Since
prefs
exposed
in
the
UI
are
/
/
sticky
they
will
always
preserve
their
user
-
branch
values
regardless
/
/
of
their
default
-
branch
values
and
as
long
as
a
pref
is
listed
as
a
/
/
fallbackPref
for
its
corresponding
Nimbus
variable
Nimbus
will
use
/
/
the
user
-
branch
value
.
So
we
could
instead
specify
fallback
prefs
in
/
/
Nimbus
and
always
access
values
through
Nimbus
instead
of
through
/
/
prefs
.
But
that
would
make
preferences
UI
code
a
little
harder
to
/
/
write
since
the
checked
state
of
a
checkbox
would
depend
on
something
/
/
other
than
its
pref
.
Since
we
'
re
already
setting
default
-
branch
values
/
/
here
as
part
of
the
previous
step
it
'
s
not
much
more
work
to
set
/
/
defaults
for
these
prefs
too
and
it
makes
the
UI
code
a
little
nicer
.
/
/
/

necessary
