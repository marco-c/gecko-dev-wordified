The
new
sidebar
builds
on
existing
legacy
sidebar
code
treating
browser
-
sidebar
.
js
as
a
SidebarController
.
As
part
of
the
new
sidebar
and
vertical
tabs
project
we
'
ve
added
new
components
including
top
-
level
system
module
SidebarManager
.
sys
.
mjs
and
a
per
window
state
manager
SidebarState
.
sys
.
ms
.
We
'
ve
added
new
UI
components
that
use
a
combination
of
moz
components
and
custom
lit
components
.
The
sidebar
team
maintains
the
existing
synced
tabs
and
history
panels
.

Every
panel
that
is
registered
and
enabled
in
browser
-
sidebar
.
js
and
the
defaultTools
map
will
show
as
an
option
in
the
Customize
Sidebar
menu
(
which
is
a
sidebar
panel
that
contains
settings
)
.
The
launcher
is
a
container
for
tools
(
ie
icons
that
when
clicked
open
or
close
the
associated
panel
)
.
Registering
a
panel
-
which
should
be
behind
a
pref
until
it
is
ready
to
be
introduced
-
does
not
automatically
add
a
new
icon
to
the
launcher
.
A
tool
can
be
added
once
for
all
users
by
adding
it
to
the
designated
pref
branch
sidebar
.
newTool
.
migration
.
in
profile
/
firefox
.
js
.
So
an
example
would
be
pref
(
"
sidebar
.
newTool
.
migration
.
bookmarks
"
'
{
}
'
)
.
The
pref
suffix
(
bookmarks
in
this
example
)
is
the
toolID
that
should
match
what
you
added
as
the
value
portion
of
the
relevant
entry
in
the
defaultTools
map
in
browser
-
sidebar
.
js
.
It
'
s
important
to
note
that
if
you
have
a
pref
governing
the
visibility
of
your
sidebar
panel
it
will
need
to
be
enabled
at
the
same
time
in
order
to
be
shown
in
a
user
'
s
launcher
-
either
via
a
nimbus
rollout
or
in
-
tree
.
If
you
only
want
to
add
this
item
if
the
pref
governing
visibility
is
true
you
can
pass
the
pref
you
want
to
observe
e
.
g
.
pref
(
"
sidebar
.
newTool
.
migration
.
reviewchecker
"
'
{
"
visibilityPref
"
:
"
browser
.
shopping
.
experience2023
.
integratedSidebar
"
}
'
)
where
browser
.
shopping
.
experience2023
.
integratedSidebar
is
the
pref
controlling
the
visibility
of
the
review
checker
panel
.
In
both
cases
the
tool
will
be
introduced
to
the
launcher
one
time
(
appended
to
a
user
'
s
customized
list
of
tools
)
and
any
customization
after
that
(
ie
removing
it
)
takes
precedence
.
If
it
'
s
not
removed
it
will
persist
after
that
session
.
