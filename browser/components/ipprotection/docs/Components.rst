IPPProxyManager
GuardianClient
Manages
communication
between
Firefox
and
the
Guardian
backend
.
It
retrieves
account
information
obtains
the
token
for
the
proxy
and
exposes
the
server
list
.
IPPChannelFilter
Main
network
component
.
It
processes
network
requests
and
decides
which
ones
should
go
through
the
proxy
.
IPPProxyManager
Implements
the
proxy
activation
/
deactivation
and
exposes
the
current
status
.
IPProtectionPanel
Controls
the
feature
s
panel
UI
.
IPPExceptionsManager
Manages
the
exceptions
UI
and
logic
(
for
example
domain
exclusions
)
in
coordination
with
the
panel
and
preferences
.
IPProtectionService
The
main
service
.
It
is
initialized
during
browser
startup
initializes
helpers
and
other
components
and
implements
the
state
machine
that
drives
the
feature
.
IPProtection
Manages
the
UI
integration
and
interactions
with
the
panel
.

IPProtectionServerlist
Provides
the
available
proxy
endpoints
(
server
list
)
to
the
proxy
manager
.
IPProtectionUsage
Gathers
usage
information
and
telemetry
related
to
proxy
activity
.
IPPNetworkErrorObserver
Observes
network
errors
related
to
the
proxy
and
notifies
the
proxy
manager
(
for
example
authentication
or
connectivity
failures
)
.
Helper
objects

-
-
-
-
The
list
of
helpers
lives
in
IPProtectionHelpers
.
sys
.
mjs
and
is
exported
as
the
IPPHelpers
array
.
Helpers
implement
small
self
contained
behaviors
and
listen
to
service
events
when
needed
.
IPPAutoStart
Activates
the
proxy
at
startup
time
when
auto
start
is
enabled
.
IPPSignInWatcher
Observes
user
authentication
state
.
It
informs
the
state
machine
when
the
user
signs
in
or
out
.
IPPStartupCache
Exposes
cached
information
to
keep
the
state
machine
responsive
during
startup
(
last
known
state
and
entitlement
JSON
object
)
.
UIHelper
Shows
and
hides
the
UI
based
on
the
current
state
machine
state
.
AccountResetHelper
Resets
stored
account
information
and
stops
the
proxy
when
the
account
becomes
unavailable
.
IPPVPNAddonHelper
Monitors
the
installation
of
the
Mozilla
VPN
add
on
and
removes
the
UI
when
appropriate
.
IPPNimbusHelper
Monitors
the
Nimbus
feature
(
NimbusFeatures
.
ipProtection
)
and
triggers
a
state
recomputation
on
updates
.
IPPEnrollAndEntitleManager
Orchestrates
the
user
enrollment
flow
with
Guardian
and
updates
the
service
when
enrollment
status
changes
.
IPPProxyManager
Manages
the
proxy
lifecycle
:
requests
proxy
passes
selects
the
active
server
and
exposes
the
connection
status
to
the
rest
of
the
feature
.
How

implement

components

Do
not
modify
the
state
machine
.
New
functionality
should
be
added
via
helper
classes
to
keep
the
core
simple
and
robust
.
Recommended
steps
:
1
.
Create
a
helper
class
with
the
methods
init
(
)
initOnStartupCompleted
(
)
and
uninit
(
)
as
appropriate
for
lifecycle
needs
.
2
.
If
your
helper
reacts
to
state
changes
listen
to
the
IPProtectionService
:
StateChanged
event
.
3
.
Add
your
helper
to
the
IPPHelpers
array
in
IPProtectionHelpers
.
sys
.
mjs
.
Be
mindful
of
ordering
if
your
helper
depends
on
others
.
For
example
IPPNimbusHelper
is
registered
last
to
avoid
premature
state
updates
triggered
by
Nimbus
immediate
callback
.
4
.
If
your
component
needs
to
recompute
the
service
state
call
IPProtectionService
.
updateState
(
)
after
updating
the
helper
data
it
relies
on
;
the
recomputation
is
synchronous
.
