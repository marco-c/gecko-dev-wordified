The
migration
wizard
is
the
piece
of
UI
that
allows
users
to
migrate
from
other
browsers
to
Firefox
.
Firefox
has
had
a
legacy
migration
wizard
for
many
years
and
this
has
historically
been
a
top
-
level
XUL
dialog
window
.
*
*
This
documentation
is
not
for
the
legacy
migration
wizard
*
*
but
is
instead
for
an
in
-
progress
replacement
migration
wizard
that
can
be
embedded
in
the
following
contexts
:
1
.
In
a
top
level
stand
-
alone
dialog
window
2
.
In
a
tab
dialog
modal
3
.
Within
privileged
about
:
pages
like
about
:
welcome
and
about
:
preferences
To
accommodate
these
contexts
the
new
migration
wizard
was
developed
as
a
reusable
component
using
pure
HTML
with
an
architecture
that
decouples
the
control
of
the
wizard
from
how
the
wizard
is
presented
to
the
user
.
This
architecture
not
only
helps
to
ensure
that
the
wizard
can
function
similarly
in
these
different
contexts
but
also
makes
the
component
viewable
in
tools
like
Storybook
for
easier
development
.

The
MigrationWizard
reusable
component
(
<
migration
-
wizard
>
)
is
a
custom
element
that
can
be
imported
from
migration
-
wizard
.
mjs
.
If
the
module
is
imported
into
a
DOM
window
context
then
the
custom
element
is
also
automatically
registered
for
that
document
.
After
binding
to
the
document
the
MigrationWizard
dispatches
a
MigrationWizard
:
Init
custom
event
which
causes
a
MigrationWizardChild
to
instantiate
and
be
associated
with
it
.
Notably
the
MigrationWizard
does
not
contain
any
internal
logic
or
privileged
code
to
perform
any
migrations
or
to
directly
interact
with
the
migration
mechanisms
.
Its
sole
function
is
to
accept
input
from
the
user
and
emit
that
input
as
events
.
The
associated
MigrationWizardChild
will
listen
for
those
events
and
take
care
of
calling
into
the
MigrationWizard
to
update
the
state
of
the
reusable
component
.
This
means
that
the
reusable
component
can
be
embedded
in
unprivileged
contexts
and
have
its
states
presented
in
a
tool
like
Storybook
.

The
MigrationWizardChild
is
a
JSWindowActorChild
(
see
JSActors
_
)
that
is
responsible
for
listening
for
events
from
a
MigrationWizard
and
then
either
updating
the
state
of
that
MigrationWizard
immediately
or
to
message
its
paired
MigrationWizardParent
to
perform
tasks
with
MigrationUtils
.
.
.
note
:
:
While
a
MigrationWizardChild
can
run
in
a
content
process
(
for
out
-
of
-
process
pages
like
about
:
welcome
)
it
can
also
run
in
parent
-
process
contexts
-
for
example
within
a
tab
dialog
or
standalone
window
dialog
.
The
same
flow
of
events
and
messaging
applies
in
all
contexts
.
The
MigrationWizardChild
also
waives
Xrays
so
that
it
can
directly
call
the
setState
method
to
update
the
appearance
of
the
MigrationWizard
.
See
XrayVision
_
for
much
more
information
on
Xrays

The
MigrationWizardParent
is
a
JSWindowActorParent
(
see
JSActors
_
)
that
is
responsible
for
listening
for
messages
from
the
paired
MigrationWizardChild
to
perform
operations
with
MigrationUtils
.
Effectively
all
of
the
heavy
lifting
of
actually
performing
the
migrations
will
be
kicked
off
by
the
MigrationWizardParent
by
calling
into
MigrationUtils
.
State
updates
for
things
like
migration
progress
will
be
sent
back
down
to
the
MigrationWizardChild
to
then
be
reflected
in
the
appearance
of
the
MigrationWizard
.
Since
the
MigrationWizard
might
be
embedded
in
unprivileged
documents
additional
checks
are
placed
in
the
message
handler
for
MigrationWizardParent
to
ensure
that
the
document
is
either
running
in
the
parent
process
or
the
privileged
about
content
process
.
The
JSActors
_
registration
for
MigrationWizardParent
and
MigrationWizardChild
also
ensures
that
the
actors
only
load
for
built
-
in
documents
