Tests
that
if
we
don
'
t
have
permission
to
read
the
contents
*
of
~
/
Library
/
Safari
that
we
can
ask
for
permission
to
do
that
.
*
*
This
involves
presenting
the
user
with
some
instructions
and
then
*
showing
a
native
folder
picker
for
the
user
to
select
the
*
~
/
Library
/
Safari
folder
.
This
seems
to
give
us
read
access
to
the
*
folder
contents
.
*
*
Revoking
permissions
for
reading
the
~
/
Library
/
Safari
folder
is
*
not
something
that
we
know
how
to
do
just
yet
.
It
seems
to
be
*
something
involving
macOS
'
s
System
Integrity
Protection
.
This
test
*
mocks
out
and
simulates
the
actual
permissions
mechanism
to
make
*
this
test
run
reliably
and
repeatably
.
