This

is
not
in
a

to
prevent
it
from

being
translated
as
the
feature
is
still
in
heavy
development

and
strings
are
likely
to
change
often
.

Fluent
isn
'
t
translating
elements
in
the
shadow
DOM
so
the
translated
strings
#

need
to
be
applied
to
the
composed
node
where
they
can
be
moved
to
the
proper

after
translation
