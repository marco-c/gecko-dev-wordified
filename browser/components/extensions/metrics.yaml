Whether

Extensions
Button
is
visible
.
Although
the
appmenu
item
is
only
shown
when
the
user
prefers
the
button
to
be
hidden
it
is
possible
for
the
button
to
be
shown
despite
the
user
'
s
preference
if
there
was
a
reason
to
show
the
button
temporarily
.
If
true
this
could
be
a
sign
that
the
user
is
confused
about
the
function
of
the
appmenu
item
because
the
Extensions
Button
offers
exactly
the
same
functionality
except
in
a
more
visible
location
(
on
the
toolbar
)

Counts
how
often
the
hidden
Extensions
Button
is
temporarily
shown
.
There
are
multiple
possible
triggers
for
showing
the
extensions
button
only
the
first
that
would
trigger
the
transition
from
hidden
to
shown
is
going
to
be
counted
.
For
example
if
the
button
is
shown
because
the
"
attention
"
dot
is
shown
and
a
permission
prompt
is
shown
then
we
only
count
the
trigger
for
the
attention
dot
not
the
permission
prompt
.
customize
is
when
the
user
entered
Customize
Mode
which
causes
the
Extensions
Button
to
show
unconditionally
until
the
user
exits
the
mode
.
addon_install_doorhanger
covers
notifications
related
to
add
-
on
installations
including
blocked
installations
add
-
on
download
progress
and
failed
installations
.
Permission
prompts
are
NOT
part
of
this
but
covered
by
extension_permission_prompt
.
A
typical
installation
flow
triggers
both
addon_install_doorhanger
and
extension_permission_prompt
.
extension_controlled_setting
is
when
a
notification
is
anchored
to
the
Extensions
Button
that
notifies
the
user
of
an
extension
-
triggered
change
(
new
tab

.
hide
(
)
)
.
This
is
shown
on
first
use
of
the
relevant
feature
after
the
installation
of
an
extension
.
browser_action_open_popup
is
when
the
browserAction
popup
is
opened
.
This
is
usually
user
-
triggered
(
shortcut
context
menu
)
or
via
the
action
.
openPopup
(
)
API
.
extension_permission_prompt
is
when
an
extension
permission
prompt
is
shown
.
This
does
not
distinguish
between
install
-
time
permission
prompts
permission
prompts
on
update
or
optional
permission
prompts
at
runtime
.
extensions_panel_showing
is
when
the
Extensions
Panel
is
being
shown
for
example
via
the
Extensions
appmenu
item
.
attention_blocklist
is
when
the
browser
wants
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
add
-
ons
has
been
blocklisted
.
attention_permission_denied
is
when
the
browser
wants
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
extensions
was
denied
access
to
the
page
in
the
currently
displayed
tab
.
The
access
request
is
not
a
strong
signal
:
a
MV3
extension
with
content
scripts
whose
permissions
have
been
revoked
by
the
user
could
trigger
such
an
attention
request
on
all
websites
.
