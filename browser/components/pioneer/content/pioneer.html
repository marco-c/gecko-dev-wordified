Many
technology
companies
use
the

sell
advertising
targeted

to
sell
your

outright
.
Pioneer
is
different
.
Our
goal
:
Put

work
for
a
better
internet
.
With
it
we
can
better
understand
pressing
issues
develop
new
products
that
can
fundamentally
change
the
tech
landscape
and
hand
more
power
and
control
back
to
users
.
You
'
ll
know
the
information
we
plan
to
collect
and
before
we
collect
it
.
We
go
to
great
lengths
to
secure
your
data
and
protect
your
privacy
.
You
can
leave
the
Pioneer
program
at
any
time
and
we
'
ll
stop
collecting
data
when
you
do
.
