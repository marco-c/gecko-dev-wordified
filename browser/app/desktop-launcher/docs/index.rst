A
substantial
number
of
users
will
upgrade
to
Windows
11
in
a
way
that
leaves
no
trace
of
Firefox
on
their
device
.
To
address
these
cases
we
will
leave
an
install
entry
point
in
their
personal
files
which
will
migrate
at
a
higher
rate
than
the
app
itself
.
In
particular
files
in
the
Desktop
folder
are
backed
up
by
OneDrive
and
other
cloud
storage
products
and
likely
to
find
their
way
back
onto
a
new
device
.
This
app
acts
as
a
replacement
for
the
desktop
shortcut
to
Firefox
.
When
Firefox
is
installed
on
the
user
'
s
machine
when
the
user
launches
this
app
it
finds
the
path
to
Firefox
in
the
appropriate
Windows
Registry
keys
and
attempts
to
launch
Firefox
from
that
path
.
When
there
is
no
Firefox
installation
found
this
app
will
attempt
to
download
and
run
the
Firefox
"
stub
"
installer
.
As
a
final
fallback
this
app
will
open
the
Firefox
download
URL
in
the
default
browser
.
