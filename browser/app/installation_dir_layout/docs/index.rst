Firefox
supports
automatic
downloading
and
applying
of
updates
while
the
user
is
still
using
the
browser
.
However
once
the
update
has
been
installed
files
that
the
browser
relies
on
may
have
changed
on
disk
which
caused
the
original
implementation
of
update
functionality
to
force
the
user
to
restart
the
browser
after
updates
.

for

and
discussion
.
)
In
order
to
let
users
continue
to
use
the
browser
after
updates
are
applied
the
updater
needs
to
leave
in
place
the
files
associated
with
the
running
browser
for
as
long
as
the
browser
'
s
process
exists
.
The
approach
we
are
taking
to
enable
this
behavior
is
a
new
installation
layout
called
"
versioned
install
directories
"
.
What
this
involves
is
:
-
Under
the
"
base
"
install
directory
there
will
be
one
or
more
"
versioned
"
install
directories
with
names
based
on
the
version
of
Firefox
installed
in
them
.
-
Each
versioned
directory
contains
a
complete
installation
of
Firefox
at
the
approapriate
version
.
-
In
the
base
install
directory
there
will
be
a
launcher
exectuable
that
launches
the
Firefox
executable
in
the
appropriate
versioned
directory
for
the
current
Firefox
version
Example
of
"
single
"
layout
This
process
allows
all
of
the
file
resolution
in
Firefox
to
remain
unchanged
(
for
example
C
:
\
\
Program
Files
\
\
Mozilla
Firefox
\
\
136
.
0
.
1a
\
\
firefox
.
exe
will
load
libraries
from
the
directory

:
\
\
Program
Files
\
\
Mozilla

.
Most
code
will
have
no
need
to
be
aware
of
the
change
.
However
when
applying
updates
to
an
installation
the
updater
needs
to
know
if
it
should
:
-
apply
updates
to
a
"
single
"
install
directory
and
leave
a
single
install
directory
in
place
(
current
behavior
)
-
apply
updates
to
a
single
install
directory
and
migrate
it
to
be
a
versioned
install
-
apply
updates
to
a
versioned
install
directory
using
the
new
versioned
install
behavior
This
means
that
the
updater
needs
a
way
to
know
unambiguously
whether
an
installation
is
using
a
single
or
versioned
layout
.
This
is
the
functionality
provided
by
this
module
.

The
installation_dir_layout
module
provides
two
different
implementations
of
a
library
installation_dir_layout
.
dll
This
library
has
a
single
function
GetInstallationDirLayoutType
which
returns
an
enumerated
type
.
The
implementation
of
installation_dir_layout
.
dll
in
the
single
directory
returns
InstallationDirLayoutType
:
:
Single
The
implementation
of
installation_dir_layout
.
dll
in
the
versioned
directory
returns
InstallationDirLayoutType
:
:
Versioned
The
interface
for
both
implementations
is
specified
in

When

is
installed
or

the
installer
or
updater
will
choose
the
appropriate
version
of
installation_dir_layout

dll
to
install
.
This
version
will
be
available
to
