Tests
that
the
identified
fields
are
updated
correctly
during
dynamic
form
changes
*
*
The
form
changes
can
be
of
two
types
(
see
FormAutofillHeuristics
.
FORM_CHANGE_REASON
)
:
*
1
.
An
element
changes
its
visibility
state
*
e
.
g
.
visible
element
becomes
invisible
or
vice
versa
*
2
.
The
form
/
document
adds
or
removes
nodes
*
*
Both
form
changes
should
make
FormAutofillChild
consider
triggering
another
identification
process
.
*
This
method
tests
that
we
identifiy
the
correct
fields
in
three
different
scenarios
:
*
1
.
Focusing
on
a
field
which
triggers
a
first
identification
process
*
2
.
Filling
a
field
that
dispatches
a
change
event
which
makes
the
site
*
change
the
form
which
triggers
a
second
field
identification
process
*
3
.
Clearing
the
value
from
the
field
which
reverts
the
previous
form
change
*
and
triggers
a
third
field
identification
process
