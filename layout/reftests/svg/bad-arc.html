The
path
contains
an
arc
with
very
large
radii
causing
float
precision
issues
.
Before
the
fix
the
approximation
of
the
arc
with
cubic
b
zier
segments
produces
large
segments
that
incorrectly
shoot
off
in
the
distance
which
leads
a
large
triangular
shape
.
After
the
fix
the
path
is
very
small
and
sligtly
off
screen
so
nothing
is
visible
.
