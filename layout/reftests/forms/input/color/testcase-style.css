This
matches
the
"

"
declaration
for
'

in

css
but
we
need
to
specify
it
here
as
well
in
order
for
the
testcases
to
match
the
reference
cases
'
renderings
on
Windows
.
This
is
because
nsNativeThemeWin
.
cpp
checks
HasAuthorSpecifiedRules
(
)
when
deciding
whether
to
apply
some
bonus
theme
-
dependent
widget
padding
.
(
And
that
function
only
considers
*
author
*
style
rules
-
not
forms
.
css
.
)
So
to
make
sure
the
testcase
and
reference
case
get
equivalent
amounts
of
bonus
padding
we
need
to
specify
an
*
author
*
-
level
declaration
for
"
padding
"
for
any
testcase
whose
reference
case
has
such
a
declaration
.
Ultimately
when
we
pref
on
input
[
type
=
"
color
"
]
by
default
we
can
just
ensure
that
it
uses
the
same
padding
as
<
button
>
in
forms
.
css
at
which
point
we
can
drop
the
"
padding
"
declaration
from
the
testcases
and
the
reference
cases
(
and
probably
drop
this
file
altogether
)
