Watch
for
raw
pointers
that
may
have
their
data
deleted
out
from
under
them
*
*
.
Examples
:
-
If
you
ever
have
a
raw
pointer
to
a
dynamically
allocated
object
it
'
s
good
to
scrutinize
whether
the
object
might
be
destroyed
before
the
last
possible
use
of
the
raw
pointer
.
For
example
:
if
you
have
a
local
variable
that
points
to
an
object
that
'
s
owned
by
a
frame
'
s
property
table

__
then
consider
whether
the
frame
might
remove
/
replace
the
property
-
table
entry
(
or
whether
the
frame
itself
might
be
destroyed
)
inside
any
of
the
function
calls
that
happen
while
the
local
pointer
is
in
scope
.
-
Be
aware
that
layout
flushes
(

FlushPendingNotifications
(
FlushType

:
Layout
)
)
can
synchronously
cause
the
frame
tree
(
and
even
the
document
!
)
to
be
destroyed
.
Specifically
:
a
layout
flush
can
synchronously
cause
resize
events
to
fire
;
and
the
event
-
listeners
for
those
events
can
run
arbitrary
script
which
could

remove
the
iframe
element
that
'
s
hosting
the
document
whose
layout
we
'
re
in
the
midst
of
flushing
;
and
that
can
cause
that
document
to
be
immediately
destroyed
if
there
aren
'
t
any
other
strong
references
keeping
it
alive
.
