Layout
Overview
Much
of
the
layout
code
deals
with
operations
on
the
frame
tree
(
or
rendering
tree
)
.
In
the
frame
tree
each
node
represents
a
rectangle
(
or
for
SVG
other
shapes
)
.
The
frame
tree
has
a
shape
similar
to
the
content
tree
since
many
content
nodes
have
one
corresponding
frame
though
it
differs
in
a
few
ways
since
some
content
nodes
have
more
than
one
frame
or
don
\
'
t
have
any
frames
at
all
.
When
elements
are
display
:
none
in
CSS
or
undisplayed
for
certain
other
reasons
they
won
\
'
t
have
any
frames
.
When
elements
are
broken
across
lines
or
pages
they
have
multiple
frames
;
elements
may
also
have
multiple
frames
when
multiple
frames
nested
inside
each
other
are
needed
to
display
a
single
element
(
for
example
a
table
a
table
cell
or
many
types
of
form
controls
)
.
Each
node
in
the
frame
tree
is
an
instance
of
a
class
derived
from
nsIFrame
.
As
with
the
content
tree
there
is
a
substantial
type
hierarchy
but
the
type
hierarchy
is
very
different
:
it
includes
types
like
text
frames
blocks
and
inlines
the
various
parts
of
tables
flex
and
grid
containers
and
the
various
types
of
HTML
form
controls
.
Frames
are
allocated
within
an
arena
owned
by
the
PresShell
.
Each
frame
is
owned
by
its
parent
;
frames
are
not
reference
counted
and
code
must
not
hold
on
to
pointers
to
frames
.
To
mitigate
potential
security
bugs
when
pointers
to
destroyed
frames
we
use
[
frame
poisoning
]
(

html
)
which
takes
two
parts
.
When
a
frame
is
destroyed
other
than
at
the
end
of
life
of
the
presentation
we
fill
its
memory
with
a
pattern
consisting
of
a
repeated
pointer
to
inaccessible
memory
and
then
put
the
memory
on
a
per
-
frame
-
class
freelist
.
This
means
that
if
code
accesses
the
memory
through
a
dangling
pointer
it
will
either
crash
quickly
by
dereferencing
the
poison
pattern
or
it
will
find
a
valid
frame
.
Like
the
content
tree
frames
must
be
accessed
only
from
the
UI
thread
.
The
frame
tree
should
not
store
any
important
data
i
.
e
.
any
data
that
cannot
be
recomputed
on
-
the
-
fly
.
While
the
frame
tree
does
usually
persist
while
a
page
is
being
displayed
frames
are
often
destroyed
and
recreated
in
response
to
certain
style
changes
and
in
the
future
we
may
do
the
same
to
reduce
memory
use
for
pages
that
are
currently
inactive
.
There
were
a
number
of
cases
where
this
rule
was
violated
in
the
past
and
we
stored
important
data
in
the
frame
tree
;
however
most
(
though
not
quite
all
)
such
cases
are
now
fixed
.
The
rectangle
represented
by
the
frame
is
what
CSS
calls
the
element
\
'
s
border
box
.
This
is
the
outside
edge
of
the
border
(
or
the
inside
edge
of
the
margin
)
.
The
margin
lives
outside
the
border
;
and
the
padding
lives
inside
the
border
.
In
addition
to
nsIFrame
:
:
GetRect
we
also
have
the
APIs
nsIFrame
:
:
GetPaddingRect
to
get
the
padding
box
(
the
outside
edge
of
the
padding
or
inside
edge
of
the
border
)
and
nsIFrame
:
:
GetContentRect
to
get
the
content
box
(
the
outside
edge
of
the
content
or
inside
edge
of
the
padding
)
.
These
APIs
may
produce
out
of
date
results
when
reflow
is
needed
(
or
has
not
yet
occurred
)
.
In
addition
to
tracking
a
rectangle
frames
also
track
two
overflow
areas
:
ink
overflow
and
scrollable
overflow
.
These
overflow
areas
represent
the
union
of
the
area
needed
by
the
frame
and
by
all
its
descendants
.
The
ink
overflow
is
used
for
painting
-
related
optimizations
:
it
is
a
rectangle
covering
all
of
the
area
that
might
be
painted
when
the
frame
and
all
of
its
descendants
paint
.
The
scrollable
overflow
represents
the
area
that
the
user
should
be
able
to
scroll
to
to
see
the
frame
and
all
of
its
descendants
.
In
some
cases
differences
between
the
frame
\
'
s
rect
and
its
overflow
happen
because
of
descendants
that
stick
out
of
the
frame
;
in
other
cases
they
occur
because
of
some
characteristic
of
the
frame
itself
.
The
two
overflow
areas
are
similar
but
there
are
differences
:
for
example
margins
are
part
of
scrollable
overflow
but
not
ink
overflow
whereas
text
-
shadows
are
part
of
ink
overflow
but
not
scrollable
overflow
.
When
frames
are
broken
across
lines
columns
or
pages
we
create
multiple
frames
representing
the
multiple
rectangles
of
the
element
.
The
first
one
is
the
primary
frame
and
the
rest
are
its
continuations
(
which
are
more
likely
to
be
destroyed
and
recreated
during
reflow
)
.
These
frames
are
linked
together
as
continuations
:
they
have
a
doubly
-
linked
list
that
can
be
used
to
traverse
the
continuations
using
nsIFrame
:
:
GetPrevContinuation
and
nsIFrame
:
:
GetNextContinuation
.
(
Currently
continuations
always
have
the
same
style
data
though
we
may
at
some
point
want
to
break
that
invariant
.
)
Continuations
are
sometimes
siblings
of
each
other
(
i
.
e
.
nsIFrame
:
:
GetNextContinuation
and
nsIFrame
:
:
GetNextSibling
might
return
the
same
frame
)
and
sometimes
not
.
For
example
if
a
paragraph
contains
a
span
which
contains
a
link
and
the
link
is
split
across
lines
then
the
continuations
of
the
span
are
siblings
(
since
they
are
both
children
of
the
paragraph
)
but
the
continuations
of
the
link
are
not
siblings
(
since
each
continuation
of
the
link
is
descended
from
a
different
continuation
of
the
span
)
.
Traversing
the
entire
frame
tree
does
*
*
not
*
*
require
explicit
traversal
of
any
frames
\
'
continuations
-
list
since
all
of
the
continuations
are
descendants
of
the
element
containing
the
break
.
We
also
use
continuations
for
cases
(
most
importantly
bidi
reordering
where
left
-
to
-
right
text
and
right
-
to
-
left
text
need
to
be
separated
into
different
continuations
since
they
may
not
form
a
contiguous
rectangle
)
where
the
continuations
should
not
be
rewrapped
during
reflow
:
we
call
these
continuations
fixed
rather
than
fluid
.
nsIFrame
:
:
GetNextInFlow
and
nsIFrame
:
:
GetPrevInFlow
traverse
only
the
fluid
continuations
and
do
not
cross
fixed
continuation
boundaries
.
If
an
inline
frame
has
non
-
inline
children
then
we
split
the
original
inline
frame
into
parts
.
The
original
inline
\
'
s
children
are
distributed
into
these
parts
like
so
:
The
children
of
the
original
inline
are
grouped
into
runs
of
inline
and
non
-
inline
and
runs
of
inline
get
an
inline
parent
while
runs
of
non
-
inline
get
an
anonymous
block
parent
.
We
call
this
\
'
ib
-
splitting
\
'
or
\
'
block
-
inside
-
inline
splitting
\
'
.
This
splitting
proceeds
recursively
up
the
frame
tree
until
all
non
-
inlines
inside
inlines
are
ancestors
of
a
block
frame
with
anonymous
block
wrappers
in
between
.
This
splitting
maintains
the
relative
order
between
these
child
frames
and
the
relationship
between
the
parts
of
a
split
inline
is
maintained
using
an
ib
-
sibling
chain
.
It
is
important
to
note
that
any
wrappers
created
during
frame
construction
(
such
as
for
tables
)
might
not
be
included
in
the
ib
-
sibling
chain
depending
on
when
this
wrapper
creation
takes
place
.

Frame
Construction
Frame
construction
is
the
process
of
creating
frames
.
This
is
done
when
styles
change
in
ways
that
require
frames
to
be
created
or
recreated
or
when
nodes
are
inserted
into
the
document
.
The
content
tree
and
the
frame
tree
don
\
'
t
have
quite
the
same
shape
and
the
frame
construction
process
does
some
of
the
work
of
creating
the
right
shape
for
the
frame
tree
.
It
handles
the
aspects
of
creating
the
right
shape
that
don
\
'
t
depend
on
layout
information
.
So
for
example
frame
construction
handles
the
work
needed
to
implement
[
table
anonymous
objects
]
(
http
:
/
/
www
.
w3
.
org
/
TR
/
CSS21
/
tables
.
html
#
anonymous
-
boxes
)
but
does
not
handle
frames
that
need
to
be
created
when
an
element
is
broken
across
lines
or
pages
.
The
basic
unit
of
frame
construction
is
a
run
of
contiguous
children
of
a
single
parent
element
.
When
asked
to
construct
frames
for
such
a
run
of
children
the
frame
constructor
first
determines
based
on
the
siblings
and
parent
of
the
nodes
involved
where
in
the
frame
tree
the
new
frames
should
be
inserted
.
Then
the
frame
constructor
walks
through
the
list
of
content
nodes
involved
and
for
each
one
creates
a
temporary
data
structure
called
a
*
*
frame
construction
item
*
*
.
The
frame
construction
item
encapsulates
various
information
needed
to
create
the
frames
for
the
content
node
:
its
style
data
some
metadata
about
how
one
would
create
a
frame
for
this
node
based
on
its
namespace
tag
name
and
styles
and
some
data
about
what
sort
of
frame
will
be
created
.
This
list
of
frame
construction
items
is
then
analyzed
to
see
whether
constructing
frames
based
on
it
and
inserting
them
at
the
chosen
insertion
point
will
produce
a
valid
frame
tree
.
If
it
will
not
the
frame
constructor
either
fixes
up
the
list
of
frame
construction
items
so
that
the
resulting
frame
tree
would
be
valid
or
throws
away
the
list
of
frame
construction
items
and
requests
the
destruction
and
re
-
creation
of
the
frame
for
the
parent
element
so
that
it
has
a
chance
to
create
a
list
of
frame
construction
items
that
it
<
em
>
{
=
html
}
can
<
/
em
>
{
=
html
}
fix
up
.
Once
the
frame
constructor
has
a
list
of
frame
construction
items
and
an
insertion
point
that
would
lead
to
a
valid
frame
tree
it
goes
ahead
and
creates
frames
based
on
those
items
.
Creation
of
a
non
-
leaf
frame
recursively
attempts
to
create
frames
for
the
children
of
that
frame
\
'
s
element
so
in
effect
frames
are
created
in
a
depth
-
first
traversal
of
the
content
tree
.
The
vast
majority
of
the
code
in
the
frame
constructor
therefore
falls
into
one
of
these
categories
:
-
Code
to
determine
the
correct
insertion
point
in
the
frame
tree
for
new
frames
.
-
Code
to
create
for
a
given
content
node
frame
construction
items
.
This
involves
some
searches
through
static
data
tables
for
metadata
about
the
frame
to
be
created
.
-
Code
to
analyze
the
list
of
frame
construction
items
.
-
Code
to
fix
up
the
list
of
frame
construction
items
.
-
Code
to

frame
construction
items

Reflow
Reflow
is
the
process
of
computing
the
positions
and
sizes
of
frames
.
(
After
all
frames
represent
rectangles
and
at
some
point
we
need
to
figure
out
exactly
\
*
what
\
*
rectangle
.
)
Reflow
is
done
recursively
with
each
frame
\
'
s
Reflow
method
calling
the
Reflow
methods
on
that
frame
\
'
s
descendants
.
In
many
cases
the
correct
results
are
defined
by
CSS
specifications
(
particularly
[
CSS

.

]
(
http
:
/
/
www
.
w3
.
org
/
TR
/
CSS21
/
visudet
.
html
)
)
.
In
some
cases
the
details
are
not
defined
by
CSS
though
in
some
(
but
not
all
)
of
those
cases
we
are
constrained
by
Web
compatibility
.
When
the
details
are
defined
by
CSS
however
the
code
to
compute
the
layout
is
generally
structured
somewhat
differently
from
the
way
it
is
described
in
the
CSS
specifications
since
the
CSS
specifications
are
generally
written
in
terms
of
constraints
whereas
our
layout
code
consists
of
algorithms
optimized
for
incremental
recomputation
.
The
reflow
generally
starts
from
the
root
of
the
frame
tree
though
some
other
types
of
frame
can
act
as
\
"
reflow
roots
\
"
and
start
a
reflow
from

Reflow
roots
must
obey
the
invariant
that
a
change
inside
one
of
their
descendants
never
changes
their
rect
or
overflow
areas
(
though
currently
scrollbars
are
reflow
roots
but
don
\
'
t
quite
obey
this
invariant
)
.
In
many
cases
we
want
to
reflow
a
part
of
the
frame
tree
and
we
want
this
reflow
to
be
efficient
.
For
example
when
content
is
added
or
removed
from
the
document
tree
or
when
styles
change
we
want
the
amount
of
work
we
need
to
redo
to
be
proportional
to
the
amount
of
content
.
We
also
want
to
efficiently
handle
a
series
of
changes
to
the
same
content
.
To
do
this
we
maintain
two
bits
on
frames
:
[
NS
\
_FRAME
\
_IS
\
_DIRTY
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
search
?
q
=
symbol
:
E_
%
3CT_nsFrameState
%
3E_NS_FRAME_IS_DIRTY
&
redirect
=
true
)
indicates
that
a
frame
and
all
of
its
descendants
require
reflow
.
[
NS
\
_FRAME
\
_HAS
\
_DIRTY
\
_CHILDREN
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
search
?
q
=
symbol
:
E_
%
3CT_nsFrameState
%
3E_NS_FRAME_HAS_DIRTY_CHILDREN
&
redirect
=
true
)
indicates
that
a
frame
has
a
descendant
that
is
dirty
or
has
had
a
descendant
removed
(
i
.
e
.
that
it
has
a
child
that
has
NS
\
_FRAME
\
_IS
\
_DIRTY
or
NS
\
_FRAME
\
_HAS
\
_DIRTY
\
_CHILDREN
or
it
had
a
child
removed
)
.
These
bits
allow
coalescing
of
multiple
updates
;
this
coalescing
is
done
in
PresShell
which
tracks
the
set
of
reflow
roots
that
require
reflow
.
The
bits
are
set
during
calls
to
[
PresShell
:
:
FrameNeedsReflow
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
search
?
q
=
PresShell
%
3A
%
3AFrameNeedsReflow
&
path
=
)
and
are
cleared
during
reflow
.
The
layout
algorithms
used
by
many
of
the
frame
classes
are
those
specified
in
CSS
which
are
based
on
the
traditional
document
formatting
model
where
widths
are
input
and
heights
are
output
.
In
some
cases
however
widths
need
to
be
determined
based
on
the
content
.
This
depends
on
two
*
intrinsic
widths
*
:
the
minimum
intrinsic
width
(
see
[
nsIFrame
:
:
GetMinISize
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
search
?
q
=
nsIFrame
%
3A
%
3AGetMinISize
&
path
=
)
)
and
the
preferred
intrinsic
width
(
see
[
nsIFrame
:
:
GetPrefISize
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
search
?
q
=
nsIFrame
%
3A
%
3AGetPrefISize
&
path
=
)
)
.
The
concept
of
what
these
widths
represent
is
best
explained
by
describing
what
they
are
on
a
paragraph
containing
only
text
:
in
such
a
paragraph
the
minimum
intrinsic
width
is
the
width
of
the
longest
word
and
the
preferred
intrinsic
width
is
the
width
of
the
entire
paragraph
laid
out
on
one
line
.
Intrinsic
widths
are
invalidated
separately
from
the
dirty
bits
described
above
.
When
a
caller
informs
the
pres
shell
that
a
frame
needs
reflow
(
PresShell
:
:
FrameNeedsReflow
)
it
passes
one
of
three
options
:
-
eResize
indicates
that
no
intrinsic
widths
are
dirty
-
eTreeChange
indicates
that
intrinsic
widths
on
it
and
its
ancestors
are
dirty
(
which
happens
for
example
if
new
children
are
added
to
it
)
-
eStyleChange
indicates
that
intrinsic
widths
on
it
its
ancestors
and
its
descendants
are
dirty
(
for
example
if
the
font
-
size
changes
)
Reflow
is
the
area
where
the
XUL
frame
classes
(
those
that
inherit
from
nsBoxFrame
or
nsLeafBoxFrame
)
are
most
different
from
the
rest
.
Instead
of
using
nsIFrame
:
:
Reflow
they
do
their
layout
computations
using
intrinsic
size
methods
called
GetMinSize
GetPrefSize
and
GetMaxSize
(
which
report
intrinsic
sizes
in
two
dimensions
)
and
a
final
layout
method
called
Layout
.
In
many
cases
these
methods
defer
some
of
the
computation
to
a
separate
object
called
a
layout
manager
.
When
an
individual
frame
\
'
s
Reflow
method
is
called
most
of
the
input
is
provided
on
an
object
called
ReflowInput
and
the
output
is
filled
in
to
an
object
called
ReflowOutput
.
After
reflow
the
caller
(
usually
the
parent
)
is
responsible
for
setting
the
frame
\
'
s
size
based
on
the
metrics
reported
.
(
This
can
make
some
computations
during
reflow
difficult
since
the
new
size
is
found
in
either
the
reflow
state
or
the
metrics
but
the
frame
\
'
s
size
is
still
the
old
size
.
However
it
\
'
s
useful
for
invalidating
the
correct
areas
that
need
to
be
repainted
.
)
One
major
difference
worth
noting
is
that
in
XUL
layout
the
size
of
the
child
is
set
prior
to
its
parent
calling
its
Layout
method
.
(
Once
invalidation
uses
display
lists
and
is
no
longer
tangled
up
in
Reflow
it
may
be
worth
switching
non
-
XUL
layout
to
work
this
way
as
well
.

Pagination
The
concepts
behind
pagination
(
also
known
as
fragmentation
)
are
a
bit
complicated
so
for
now
we
\
'
ve
split
them
off
into
a
separate
document
:
[
Gecko
:
Continuation
\
_Model
]
(
