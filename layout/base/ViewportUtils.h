Return
a
transform
to
be
applied
to
the
coordinates
of
input
events
targeting
content
inside
the
scroll
frame
identified
by
|
aScrollId
|
which
converts
from
"
visual
coordinates
"
(
which
are
the
coordinates
events
have
when
they
arrive
from
APZ
)
to
"
layout
coordinates
"
(
which
are
the
coordinates
used
in
most
places
by
layout
code
)
.
The
transform
has
two
components
:
1
.
The
pres
shell
resolution
representing
the
pinch
-
zoom
scale
(
if
the
scroll
frame
|
aScrollId
|
is
inside
the
resolution
which
is
most
of
the
time
)
.
2
.
A
translation
representing
async
scrolling
.
This
can
contain
:
-
For
any
scroll
frame
a
scroll
component
resulting
from
the
main
thread
incompletely
applying
an
APZ
-
requested
scroll
position
.
-
For
the
RCD
-
RSF
only
a
persistent
component
representing
the
offset
of
the
visual
viewport
relative
to
the
layout
viewport
.
The
translation
is
accumulated
for
all
scroll
frames
form
|
aScrollId
|
up
to
the
root
using
values
populated
in
APZCCallbackHelper
:
:
UpdateCallbackTransform
.
