identified
by
|
aScrollId
|
which
converts
from
"
visual
coordinates
"
(
which
are
the
coordinates
events
have
when
they
arrive
from
APZ
)
to
"
layout
coordinates
"
(
which
are
the
coordinates
used
in
most
places
by
layout
code
)
.
The
transform
has
two
components
:

.
The
pres
shell
resolution

RSF
only
a

is
accumulated
for
all
