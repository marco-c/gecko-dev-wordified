A
logical
property
group
is
one
that
defines
the
corresponding
physical
/
/
longhand
properties
that
could
be
set
by
a
given
set
of
logical
longhand
/
/
properties
.
For
example
the
logical
property
group
for
margin
-
block
-
start
/
/
(
and
the
other
three
logical
margin
properties
)
is
one
that
contains
/
/
margin
-
top
margin
-
right
margin
-
bottom
and
margin
-
left
.
/
/
/
/
Logical
property
groups
are
defined
below
using
one
of
the
following
/
/
macros
:
/
/
/
/
CSS_PROP_LOGICAL_GROUP_SHORTHAND
(
name_
)
/
/
Defines
a
logical
property
group
whose
corresponding
physical
/
/
properties

a
given
shorthand
.
For
example
the
/
/
logical
property
group
for
margin
-
{
block
inline
}
-
{
start
end
}
/
/
is
defined
by
the
margin
shorthand
.
The
name_
argument

/
/
be
the
method_
name
of
the
shorthand
(
so
Margin
rather
than
/
/
margin
)
.
