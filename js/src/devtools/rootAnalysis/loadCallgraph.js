Functions
come
out
of
sixgill
in
the
form
"
mangled
readable
"
.
The
mangled
/
/
name
is
Truth
.
One
mangled
name
might
correspond
to
multiple
readable
names
/
/
for
multiple
reasons
including
(

)
sixgill
/
gcc
doesn
'
t
always
qualify
types
/
/
the
same
way
or
de

typedef
the
same
amount
;
(

)
sixgill
'
s
output
treats
/
/
references
and
pointers
the
same
and
so
doesn
'
t
distinguish
them
but
C
+
+
/
/
treats
them
as
separate
for
overloading
and
linking
;
(

)
(
identical
)
/
/
destructors
sometimes
have
an
int32
parameter
sometimes
not
.
/
/
/
/
The
readable
names
are
useful
because
they
'
re
far
more
meaningful
to
the
/
/
user
and
are
what
should
show
up
in
reports
and
questions
to
mrgiggles
.
At
/
/
least
in
most
cases
it
'
s
fine
to
have
the
extra
mangled
name
tacked
onto
/
/
the
beginning
for
these
.
/
/
/
/
The
strategy
used
is
to
separate
out
the
pieces
whenever
they
are
read
in
/
/
create
a
table
mapping
mangled
names
to
all
readable
names
and
use
the
/
/
mangled
names
in
all
computation
-
-
except
for
limited
circumstances
when
/
/
the
readable
name
is
used
in
annotations
.
/
/
/
/
Note
that
callgraph
.
txt
uses
a
compressed
representation
-
-
each
name
is
/
/
mapped
to
an
integer
and
those
integers
are
what
is
recorded
in
the
edges
.
/
/
But
the
integers
depend
on
the
full
name
whereas
the
true
edge
should
only
/
/
consider
the
mangled
name
.
And
some
of
the
names
encoded
in
callgraph
.
txt
/
/
are
FieldCalls
not
just
function
names
.
