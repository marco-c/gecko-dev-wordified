Nursery
dependent

-

-
>
nursery
base
NB4
that
is
/
/
deduplicated
.
The
difficulty
is
that
ND2
needs
to
update
its
chars
pointer
/
/
because
of
the
root
base
NB4
being
deduplicated
but
if
TD3
'
s
whole
cell
/
/
buffer
entry
is
processed
first
then
it
will
no
longer
have
a
pointer
to
NB4
/
/
and
cannot
recover
the
original
chars
pointer
.
/
/
/
/
Note
that
this
case
as
-
is
cannot
happen
in
practice
because
it
requires
a
/
/
nursery
-
>
tenured
-
>
nursery
dependent
chain
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
/
/
create
because
most
paths
that
create
dependent
strings
will
collapse
base
/
/
chains
and
make
the
dependent
string
point
directly
at
its
root
base
.
Rope
/
/
flattening
is
the
one
exception
but
you
'
d
still
need
to
arrange
for
the
/
/
dependency
chain
to
cross
back
and
forth
between
the
tenured
heap
and
the
/
/
nursery
.
/
/
/
/
It
is
difficult
to
create
a
nursery
-
>
tenured
edge
with
string
flattening
/
/
because
that
would
require
creating
a
tenured
rope
with
nursery
children
.
/
/
Given
that
the
children
must
be
created
before
the
rope
that
points
to
them
/
/
that
means
the
rope
creation
would
need
to
be
pretenured
or
similar
.
/

This
case

does

happen
in

page

I
'
m
not
totally
/

clear
on
how
.
But
it
'

actually
the
simpler
case
where
no
deduplication
is
/

involved
just
a
