JIT
Optimization
Outcomes
SpiderMonkey

s
optimizing
JIT
IonMonkey
uses
a
number
of
different
optimization
strategies
to
speed
up
various
operations
.
The
most
commonplace
operations
that
are
relevant
for
fast
program
execution
are
property
accesses
and
function
calls
.
This
page
documents
the
meaning
of
different
optimization
outcomes
.
#
#
General
Outcomes
General
outcomes
shared
between
various
optimization
strategies
.
#
#
#
GenericFailure
The
optimization
attempt
failed
and
the
reason
was
not
recorded
.
#
#
#
GenericSuccess
Optimization
succeeded
.
#
#
#
Disabled
#
#
#
NoTypeInfo
Optimization
failed
because
there
was
no
type
information
associated
with
object
containing
the
property
.
This
failure
mode
is
unlikely
and
occurs
if
the
target
object
is
obtained
in
some
roundabout
way
.
#
#
#
NoAnalysisInfo
#
#
#
NoShapeInfo
#
#
#
UnknownObject
#
#
#
UnknownProperties
#
#
#
UnknownProperties
Optimization
failed
because
the
object
containing
the
property
was
marked
as
having
unknown
properties
.
This
can
happen
if
too
many
properties
are
defined
on
the
object
or
if
delete
is
used
to
remove
one
of
the
object
'
s
properties
.
#
#
#
Singleton
#
#
#
NotSingleton
#
#
#
NotSingleton
Optimization
failed
because
the
object
containing
the
property
did
not
have
a
'
singleton
'
type
.
Singleton
types
are
assigned
to
objects
that
are
"
one
of
a
kind
"
such
as
global
objects
literal
objects
declared
in
the
global
scope
and
top
-
level
function
objects
.
#
#
#
NotFixedSlot
#
#
#
InconsistentFixedSlot
#
#
#
NotObject
Optimization
failed
because
the
stored
in
the
property
could
potentially
be
a
non
-
object
value
.
Since
only
objects
can
be
uniquely
typed
the
optimization
strategy
fails
in
this
case
.
#
#
#
NotStruct
The
object
holding
the
property
is
not
a
typed
struct
object
.
#
#
#
NotUnboxed
#
#
#
UnboxedConvertedToNative
#
#
#
StructNoField
The
property
being
accessed
does
not
correspond
to
a
field
on
typed
object
.
#
#
#
InconsistentFieldType
#
#
#
InconsistentFieldOffset
#
#
#
NeedsTypeBarrier
Optimization
failed
because
somehow
the
property
was
accessed
in
a
way
that
returned
a
different
type
than
the
expected
constant
.
This
is
an
unlikely
failure
mode
and
should
not
occur
.

it
is

Optimization
failed
because

support
was
not
enabled
.
#
#
#
SimdTypeNotOptimized
The
type
observed
as
being
retrieved
from
this
property
access
did
not
match
an
optimizable
type
.

The

on
the
object
is
not
one
of
the
optimizable
property
names
