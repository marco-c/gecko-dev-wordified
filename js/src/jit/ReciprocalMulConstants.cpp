NOTE
:
The
following
explanation
assumes
T
=
uint32_t
but
/
/
T
=
uint64_t
works
similar
.
/
/
/
/
Speeding
up
division
by
non
power
-
of
-
2
constants
is
possible
by
/
/
calculating
during
compilation
a
value
M
such
that
high
-
order
/
/
bits
of
M
*
n
correspond
to
the
result
of
the
division
of
n
by
d
.
/
/
No
value
of
M
can
serve
this
purpose
for
arbitrarily
big
values
/
/
of
n
but
for
optimizing
integer
division
we
'
re
just
concerned
/
/
with
values
of
n
whose
absolute
value
is
bounded
(
by
fitting
in
/
/
an
integer
type
say
)
.
With
this
in
mind
we
'
ll
find
a
constant
/
/
M
as
above
that
works
for
-
2
^
maxLog
<
=
n
<
2
^
maxLog
;
maxLog
can
/
/
then
be
31
for
signed
division
or
32
for
unsigned
division
.

The

of
this

A

of
correctness

for

version
follows
;
we
'
ll
denote
maxLog

in
the
proof

for
conciseness
.
/

/
/
Formally
for

we

compute

M

in

(

Define
p
=
32

s
M
=
ceil
(

and
assume
that

M

p

2
^
(
p
-
L
)

d
.
(

)
/
/
(
Observe
that
p
=
CeilLog32
(
d
)
+
L
satisfies
this
as
the
right
/
/
side
of
(

at

one
in

)
.
Then

If

then
M

(

)
-

.

Proof
:
Indeed
M
is
monotone
in
p
and
for
p

to
the
above
/
/
value

bounds

^

^
(

imply
that

The

For

Proof
:
Put
x
=
floor
(
Mn
/
2
^
p
)
;
it
'
s
the
unique
integer
for
which
/

Mn

^
p
-
1
<
x
<
=

Using
M

^
p
/
d
on
the
LHS
and
(

on

we
get

d

n
/
(
2
^
L
d
)
<
n

1
/
d
.
/
/
Since
x
is
an
integer
it
'
s
not
in
the
interval
(
n
/
d
(
n

1
)
/
d
)
/
/
and
so
n
/
d
-
1
<
x
<
=
n
/
d
which
implies
x
=
floor
(
n

For

floor
(

Proof
:
The
proof
is
similar
.
Equation
(
2
)
holds
as
above
.
Using
/
/
M
>
2
^
p
/
d
(
d
isn
'
t
a
power
of
2
)
on
the
RHS
and
(
1
)
on
the
LHS
/
/
n
/
d
+
n
/
(
2
^
L
d
)
-
1
<
x
<
n
/
d
.
/
/
Using
n

=
-
2
^
L
and
summing
1
/
/
n
/
d
-
1
/
d
<
x
+
1
<
n
/
d
+
1
.
/
/
Since
x
+
1
is
an
integer
this
implies
n
/
d
<
=
x
+
1
<
n
/
d
+
1
.
/
/
In
other
words
x
+
1
=
ceil
(
n
/
d
)
.

Condition
(

isn
