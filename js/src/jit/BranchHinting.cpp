Implementation
of
the
branch
hinting
proposal
/
/
Some
control
instructions
(
if
and
br_if
)
can
have
a
hint
of
the
form
/
/
likely
or
unlikely
.
That
means
a
specific
branch
will
be
likely
/
unlikely
/
/
to
be
executed
at
runtime
.
/
/
This
pass
will
propagate
the
branch
hints
to
successor
blocks
in
the
CFG
.
/
/
Currently
we
use
the
branch
hinting
information
for
the
following
:
/
/
-
Unlikely
blocks
are
moved
out
of
line
this
is
done
at
the
LIR
level
.

blocks

{

(

"
)
;
/
*
This
pass
propagates
branch
hints
across
the
control
flow
graph
using
dominator
information
.
Branch
hints
are
read
at
compile
-
time
for
specific
basic
blocks
.
This
pass
propagates
this
property
to
successor
blocks
in
a
conservative
way
.
The
algorithm
works
as
follows
:
-
The
CFG
is
traversed
in
reverse
-
post
-
order
(
RPO
)
.
Dominator
parents
are
visited
before
the
blocks
they
dominate
.
-
For
each
basic
block
if
we
have
a
hint
it
is
propagated
to
the
blocks
it
immediately
dominates
(
its
children
in
the
dominator
tree
)
.
-
The
pass
will
then
continue
to
work
its
way
through
the
CFG
.
Because
we
only
propagate
along
dominator
-
tree
edges
(
parent
-
>
child
)
each
block
receives
information
from
exactly
one
source
.
This
avoids
conflicts
that
would
otherwise
arise
at
CFG
join
points
.
