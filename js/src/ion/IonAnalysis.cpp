The
type
analyzer
attempts
to
decide
every
instruction
'
s
output
type
.
The
/
/
following
properties
of
instructions
are
used
:
/
/
/
/
*
Assumed
Type
.
This
encodes
information
from
the
TypeOracle
.
For
example
/
/
it
may
suggest
that
a
BitAnd
is
known
to
not
be
specialized
or
that
a
/
/
getprop
is
known
to
be
an
integer
.
/
/
/
/
*
Requested
Types
.
This
is
a
bit
vector
of
the
types
required
by
uses
.
/
/
/
/
*
Result
Type
.
This
is
the
type
that
will
be
used
based
on
analysis
of
/
/
uses
.
Some
operations
have
a
fixed
result
type
.
For
example
a
BitAnd
/
/
always
returns
an
integer
and
uses
which
request
a
wider
type
must
/
/
explicitly
convert
it
.
/
/
/
/
The
algorithm
works
as
follows
:
/
/
*
Each
instruction
is
added
to
a
worklist
.
/
/
*
For
each
instruction
in
the
worklist
/
/
*
The
instruction
decides
based
on
its
assumed
type
its
ideal
inputs
/
/
types
.
These
are
propagated
to
its
inputs
'
requested
types
.
/
/
*
The
instruction
decides
based
on
its
inputs
if
it
should
widen
its
/
/
result
type
.
/
/
*
If
any
type
information
changes
its
uses
and
inputs
are
re
-
added
to
/
/
the
worklist
.
/
/
*
During
the
lowering
phase
each
instruction
decides
whether
to
specialize
/
/
as
a
specific
type
and
whether
to
add
conversion
operations
to
its
/
/
inputs
.
