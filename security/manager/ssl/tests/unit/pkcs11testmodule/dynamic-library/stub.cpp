The
build
system
builds
the
rust
library
pkcs11testmodule
as
a
static
/
/
library
called
pkcs11testmodule
-
static
.
On
macOS
and
Windows
that
static
/
/
library
can
be
linked
with
an
empty
file
and
turned
into
a
shared
library
/
/
with
the
function
C_GetFunctionList
exposed
.
Unfortunately
on
Linux
/
/
exposing
the
C_GetFunctionList
in
the
static
library
doesn
'
t
work
for
some
/
/
unknown
reason
.
As
a
workaround
this
file
declares
its
own
/
/
C_GetFunctionList
that
can
be
exposed
in
the
shared
library
.
It
then
calls
/
/
the
function
PKCS11TestModule_GetFunctionList
exposed
(
internally
to
the
/
/
linkage
in
question
)
by
pkcs11testmodule
-
static
.
This
enables
the
build
/
/
system
to
ultimately
turn
pkcs11testmodule
-
static
into
a
shared
library
that
/
/
exposes
a
C_GetFunctionList
function
meaning
it
can
be
used
as
a
PKCS
#
11
/
/
module
.
extern
"
C
"
{
CK_RV
PKCS11TestModule_GetFunctionList
(
CK_FUNCTION_LIST_PTR_PTR
ppFunctionList
)
;
CK_RV
C_GetFunctionList
(
CK_FUNCTION_LIST_PTR_PTR

{
