This
feature
is
obsolete
.
Although
it
may
still
work
in
some
browsers
its
use
is
discouraged
since
it
could
be
removed
at
any
time
.
Try
to
avoid
using
it
.
The
opaque
PRThreadStack
structure
is
only
used
in
the
third
argument
"
PRThreadStack
*
stack
"
to
the
PR_AttachThread
function
.
The
'
stack
'
argument
is
now
obsolete

You
should
pass
NULL
as
the
'
stack
'
argument
to
PR_AttachThread
.
