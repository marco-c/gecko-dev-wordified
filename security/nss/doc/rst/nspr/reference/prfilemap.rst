The
opaque
structure
PRFileMap
represents
a
memory
-
mapped
file
object
.
Before
actually
mapping
a
file
to
memory
you
must
create
a
memory
-
mapped
file
object
by
calling
PR_CreateFileMap
which
returns
a
pointer
to
PRFileMap
.
Then
sections
of
the
file
can
be
mapped
into
memory
by
passing
the
PRFileMap
pointer
to
PR_MemMap
.
The
memory
-
mapped
file
object
is
closed
by
passing
the
PRFileMap
pointer
to
PR_CloseFileMap
.
