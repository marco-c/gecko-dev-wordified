_Description
:
Description
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
The
socket
fd
is
a
rendezvous
socket
that
has
been
bound
to
an
address
with
PR_Bind
and
is
listening
for
connections
after
a
call
to
PR_Listen
.
PR_Accept
accepts
the
first
connection
from
the
queue
of
pending
connections
and
creates
a
new
socket
for
the
newly
accepted
connection
.
The
rendezvous
socket
can
still
be
used
to
accept
more
connections
.
If
the
addr
parameter
is
not
NULL
PR_Accept
stores
the
address
of
the
connecting
entity
in
the
PRNetAddr
object
pointed
to
by
addr
.
PR_Accept
blocks
the
calling
thread
until
either
a
new
connection
is
successfully
accepted
or
an
error
occurs
.
If
the
timeout
parameter
is
not
PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT
and
no
pending
connection
can
be
accepted
before
the
time
limit
PR_Accept
returns
NULL
with
the
error
code
PR_IO_TIMEOUT_ERROR
.
