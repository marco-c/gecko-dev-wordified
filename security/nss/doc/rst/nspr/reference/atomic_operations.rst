This
chapter
describes
the
global
functions
you
use
to
perform
atomic
operations
.
The
functions
define
a
portable
API
that
may
be
reliably
used
in
any
environment
.
Since
not
all
operating
environments
provide
access
to
such
functions
their
performance
may
vary
considerably
.

The
API
defined
for
the
atomic
functions
is
consistent
across
all
supported
platforms
.
However
the
implementation
may
vary
greatly
and
hence
the
performance
.
On
systems
that
do
not
provide
direct
access
to
atomic
operators
NSPR
emulates
the
capabilities
by
using
its
own
locking
mechanisms
.
For
such
systems
NSPR
performs
atomic
operations
just
as
efficiently
as
the
client
could
.
Therefore
to
preserve
portability
it
is
recommended
that
clients
use
the
NSPR
API
for
atomic
operations
.
These
functions
operate
on
32
-
bit
integers
:
-
PR_AtomicIncrement
-
PR_AtomicDecrement
-
PR_AtomicSet
-
PR_AtomicAdd
These
functions
implement
a
simple
stack
data
structure
:
-
PR_CreateStack
-
PR_StackPush
-
PR_StackPop
-
PR_DestroyStack
