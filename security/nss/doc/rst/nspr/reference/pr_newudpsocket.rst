UDP

Protocol
)
is
a
connectionless
unreliable
datagram
protocol
of
the
TCP
/
IP
protocol
suite
.
UDP
datagrams
may
be
lost
or
delivered
in
duplicates
or
out
of
sequence
.
PR_NewUDPSocket
creates
a
new
UDP
socket
.
The
socket
may
be
bound
to
a
well
-
known
port
number
with
PR_Bind
.
Datagrams
can
be
sent
with
PR_SendTo
and
received
with
PR_RecvFrom
.
When
the
socket
is
no
longer
needed
it
should
be
closed

PR_NewUDPSocket
is
deprecated
because
it
is
hardcoded
to
create
an
IPv4
UDP
socket
.
New
code
should
use
PR_OpenUDPSocket
instead
which
allows
the
address
family
(
IPv4
or
IPv6
)
of
the
new
UDP
socket
to
be
specified
.
