You
use
PR_AttachThread
when
you
want
to
use
NSS
functions
on
the
native
thread
that
was
not
created
with
NSPR
.
PR_AttachThread
informs
NSPR
about
the
new
thread
by
associating
a
PRThread
object
with
the
native
thread
.
The
thread
object
is
automatically
destroyed
when
it
is
no
longer
needed
.
You
don
'
t
need
to
call
PR_AttachThread
unless
you
create
your
own
native
thread
.
PR_Init
calls
PR_AttachThread
automatically
for
the
primordial
thread
.

PR_AttachThread
and
PR_DetachThread
are
obsolete
.
A
native
thread
not
created
by
NSPR
is
automatically
attached
the
first
time
it
calls
an
NSPR
function
and
automatically
detached
when
it
exits
.
In
NSPR
release
19980529B
and
earlier
it
is
necessary
for
a
native
thread
not
created
by
NSPR
to
call
PR_AttachThread
before
it
calls
any
NSPR
functions
and
call
PR_DetachThread
when
it
is
done
calling
NSPR
functions
.
