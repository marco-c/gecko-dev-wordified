-
-
TCP
(
Transmission
Control
Protocol
)
is
a
connection
-
oriented
reliable
byte
-
stream
protocol
of
the
TCP
/
IP
protocol
suite
.
PR_NewTCPSocket
creates
a
new
IPv4
TCP
socket
.
A
TCP
connection
is
established
by
a
passive
socket
(
the
server
)
accepting
a
connection
setup
request
from
an
active
socket
(
the
client
)
.
Typically
the
server
binds
its
socket
to
a
well
-
known
port
with
PR_Bind
calls
PR_Listen
to
start
listening
for
connection
setup
requests
and
calls
PR_Accept
to
accept
a
connection
.
The
client
makes
a
connection
request
using
PR_Connect
.
After
a
connection
is
established
the
client
and
server
may
send
and
receive
data
between
each
other
.
To
receive
data
one
can
call
PR_Read
or
PR_Recv
.
To
send
data
one
can
call
PR_Write
PR_Writev
PR_Send
or
PR_TransmitFile
.
PR_AcceptRead
is
suitable
for
use
by
the
server
to
accept
a
new
client
connection
and
read
the
client
'
s
first
request
in
one
function
call
.
A
TCP
connection
can
be
shut
down
by
PR_Shutdown
and
the
sockets
should
be
closed
by
PR_Close
.

PR_NewTCPSocket
is
deprecated
because
it
is
hardcoded
to
create
an
IPv4
TCP
socket
.
New
code
should
use
PR_OpenTCPSocket
instead
which
allows
the
address
family
(
IPv4
or
IPv6
)
of
the
new
TCP
socket
to
be
specified
.
