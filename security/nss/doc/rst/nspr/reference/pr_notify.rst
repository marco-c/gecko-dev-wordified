Notification
of
a
monitor
signals
the
change
of
state
of
some
monitored
data
.
The
changing
of
that
data
and
the
notification
must
all
be
performed
while
in
the
monitor
.
When
the
notification
occurs
the
runtime
promotes
a
thread
that
is
waiting
on
the
monitor
to
a
ready
state
.
If
more
than
one
thread
is
waiting
the
selection
of
which
thread
gets
promoted
cannot
be
determined
in
advance
.
This
implies
that
all
threads
waiting
on
a
single
monitor
must
have
the
same
semantics
.
If
no
thread
is
waiting
on
the
monitor
the
notify
operation
is
a
no
-
op
.
