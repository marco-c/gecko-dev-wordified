The
opaque
PLHashTable
structure
represents
a
hash
table
.
Entries
in
the
table
have
the
type
PLHashEntry
and
are
organized
into
buckets
.
The
number
of
buckets
in
a
hash
table
may
be
changed
by
the
library
functions
during
the
lifetime
of
the
table
to
optimize
speed
and
space
.
A
new
hash
table
is
created
by
the
PL_NewHashTable
function
and
destroyed
by
the
PL_HashTableDestroy
function
.
