PR_JoinThread
is
used
to
synchronize
the
termination
of
a
thread
.
The
function
is
synchronous
in
that
it
blocks
the
calling
thread
until
the
target
thread
is
in
a
joinable
state
.
PR_JoinThread
returns
to
the
caller
only
after
the
target
thread
returns
from
its
root
function
.
PR_JoinThread
must
not
be
called
until
after
PR_CreateThread
has
returned
.
If
PR_JoinThread
is
not
called
on
the
same
thread
as
PR_CreateThread
then
it
is
the
caller
'
s
responsibility
to
ensure
that
PR_CreateThread
has
completed
.
Several
threads
cannot
wait
for
the
same
thread
to
complete
.
One
of
the
calling
threads
operates
successfully
and
the
others
terminate
with
the
error
PR_FAILURE
.
The
calling
thread
is
not
blocked
if
the
target
thread
has
already
terminated
.
PR_JoinThread
is
interruptable
.
