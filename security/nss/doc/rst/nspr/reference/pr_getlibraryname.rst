This
function
constructs
a
full
path
name
from
the
specified
directory
name
and
library
name
.
The
constructed
path
name
refers
to
the
actual
dynamically
loaded
library
.
It
is
suitable
for
use
in
the
PR_LoadLibrary
call
.
This
function
does
not
test
for
existence
of
the
specified
file
it
just
constructs
the
full
filename
.
The
way
the
name
is
constructed
is
system
dependent
.
If
sufficient
storage
cannot
be
allocated
to
contain
the
constructed
path
name
the
function
returns
NULL
.
Storage
for
the
result
is
allocated
by
the
runtime
and
becomes
the
responsibility
of
the
caller
.
When
it
is
no
longer
used
free
it
using
PR_FreeLibraryName
.
