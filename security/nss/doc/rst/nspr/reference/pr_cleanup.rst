_Description

-
PR_Cleanup
must
be
called
by
the
primordial
thread
near
the
end
of
the
main
function
.
PR_Cleanup
attempts
to
synchronize
the
natural
termination
of
the
process
.
It
does
so
by
blocking
the
caller
if
and
only
if
it
is
the
primordial
thread
until
all
user
threads
have
terminated
.
When
the
primordial
thread
returns
from
main
the
process
immediately
and
silently
exits
.
That
is
the
process
(
if
necessary
)
forcibly
terminates
any
existing
threads
and
exits
without
significant
blocking
and
without
error
messages
or
core
files
.
