PR_AttachThread
and
PR_DetachThread
are
obsolete
.
A
native
thread
not
created
by
NSPR
is
automatically
attached
the
first
time
it
calls
an
NSPR
function
and
automatically
detached
when
it
exits
.
In
NSPR
release
19980529B
and
earlier
it
is
necessary
for
a
native
thread
not
created
by
NSPR
to
call
PR_AttachThread
before
it
calls
any
NSPR
functions
and
call
PR_DetachThread
when
it
is
done
calling
NSPR
functions
.
