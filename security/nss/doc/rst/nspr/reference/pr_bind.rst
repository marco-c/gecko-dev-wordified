-
-
-
-
When
a
new
socket
is
created
it
has
no
address
bound
to
it
.
PR_Bind
assigns
the
specified
address
(
also
known
as
name
)
to
the
socket
.
If
you
do
not
care
about
the
exact
IP
address
assigned
to
the
socket
set
the
inet
.
ip
field
of
PRNetAddr
to
PR_htonl
\
(
PR_INADDR_ANY
)
.
If
you
do
not
care
about
the
TCP
/
UDP
port
assigned
to
the
socket
set
the
inet
.
port
field
of
PRNetAddr
to
0
.
Note
that
if
PR_Connect
is
invoked
on
a
socket
that
is
not
bound
it
implicitly
binds
an
arbitrary
address
the
socket
.
Call
PR_GetSockName
to
obtain
the
address
(
name
)
bound
to
a
socket
.
