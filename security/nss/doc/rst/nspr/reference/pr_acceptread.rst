The
function
has
the
following
parameters
:
listenSock
A
pointer
to
a
PRFileDesc
object
representing
a
socket
descriptor
that
has
been
called
with
the
PR_Listen
function
also
known
as
the
rendezvous
socket
.
acceptedSock
A
pointer
to
a
pointer
to
a
PRFileDesc
object
.
On
return
*
acceptedSock
points
to
the
PRFileDesc
object
for
the
newly
connected
socket
.
This
parameter
is
valid
only
if
the
function
return
does
not
indicate
failure
.
peerAddr
A
pointer
a
pointer
to
a
PRNetAddr
object
.
On
return
peerAddr
points
to
the
address
of
the
remote
socket
.
The
PRNetAddr
object
that
peerAddr
points
to
will
be
in
the
buffer
pointed
to
by
buf
.
This
parameter
is
valid
only
if
the
function
return
does
not
indicate
failure
.
buf
A
pointer
to
a
buffer
to
hold
data
sent
by
the
peer
and
the
peer
'
s
address
.
This
buffer
must
be
large
enough
to
receive
amount
bytes
of
data
and
two
PRNetAddr
structures
(
thus
allowing
the
runtime
to
align
the
addresses
as
needed
)
.
amount
The
number
of
bytes
of
data
to
receive
.
Does
not
include
the
size
of
the
PRNetAddr
structures
.
If
0
no
data
will
be
read
from
the
peer
.
timeout
The
timeout
interval
only
applies
to
the
read
portion
of
the
operation
.
PR_AcceptRead
blocks
indefinitely
until
the
connection
is
accepted
;
the
read
will
time
out
after
the
timeout
interval
elapses
.
.
.

-
A
positive
number
indicates
the
number
of
bytes
read
from
the
peer
.
-
The
value
-
1
indicates
a
failure
.
The
reason
for
the
failure
can
be
obtained
by
calling
PR_GetError
