I
own
this
crate
and
most
of
its
versions
were
codeveloped
and
reviewed
by
Nika
Layzell
.
This
version
was
not
explicitly
reviewed
by
her
but
it
was
specifically
a
release
that
made
the
code
pass
miri
and
was
reviewed
by
me
.
Firefox
uses
it
in
the
gecko
-
ffi
configuration
which
is
less
thoroughly
tested
and
more
dangerous
but
we
'
re
reasonably
confident
in
it
.
The
real
danger
is
from
C
+
+
code
failing
to
use
it
correctly
in
FFI
but
that
'
s
just
how
FFI
is
