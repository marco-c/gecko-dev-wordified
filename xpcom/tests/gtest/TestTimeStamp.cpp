Now
(

is
trying
to
ensure
the
best
possible
precision
on
each
platform
/
/
but
guarantees
at
least
one
millisecond
resolution
.
Given
the
huge
/
/
difference
between
the
assumed
resolution
of
the
clock
on
modern
CPUs
/
/
(
<
100ns
often
close
to
1ns
as
of
2025
)
and
that
guarantee
we
can
safely
/
/
test
for
1ms
without
fearing
intermittents
caused
by
jitter
.
