Function
-
like
class
that
performs
eager
computation
of
_get_locally_changed_files
    
for
what
looks
the
default
repo
.
    
The
rationale
is
the
following
:
    
-
computing
_get_locally_changed_files
is
relatively
slow
(
~
600ms
)
    
-
it
'
s
already
done
through
an
external
command
    
So
we
do
that
in
a
background
thread
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
at
the
    
point
when
we
need
the
result
it
'
s
already
prefetched
'
