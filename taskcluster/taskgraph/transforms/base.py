Container
for
a
sequence
of
transforms
.
Each
transform
is
represented
as
a
    
callable
taking
(
config
items
)
and
returning
a
generator
which
will
yield
    
transformed
items
.
The
resulting
sequence
has
the
same
interface
.
    
This
is
convenient
to
use
in
a
file
full
of
transforms
as
it
provides
a
    
decorator
transforms
.
add
that
will
add
the
decorated
function
to
the
    
sequence
