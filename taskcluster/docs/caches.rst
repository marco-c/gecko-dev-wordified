There
are
various
caches
used
by
the
in

tree
tasks
.
This
page
attempts
to
document
them
and
their
appropriate
use
.

This

:
this
is
the
historical
data
of
a
Mercurial
repository
(
as
opposed
to
a
checkout
or
working
directory
)
.
This
cache
should
ideally
be
written
to
by
the
hg
robustcheckout
command
which
is
the
preferred
mechanism
to
clone
a
Mercurial
repository
in
automation
.
When
using
hg
robustcheckout
data
for
the
same
logical
repository
will
automatically
be
stored
in
the
same
directory
in
this
cache
.

data
for
the
Firefox
repository
will
be
in
the
directory
8ba995b74e18334ab3707f27e9eb8f4e37ba3d29
which
is
the
SHA
-
1
of
the
first
revision
in
the
Firefox
repository
.
This
helps
ensure
that
any
given
changeset
is
only
stored
once
in
the
cache
.
This
is
why
there
is
no
{
{
project
}
}
component
in
the
cache
name
.

version
control
checkouts
each
in
a
subdirectory
named
after
the
repo
(

)
.
Checkouts
should
be
read

only
.
If
a
task
needs
to
create
new
files
from
content
of
a
checkout
this
content
should
be
written
in
a
separate
directory
/
cache
(
like
a
workspace
)

This

is
used
internally
by

-
vcs
.
This

is
deprecated
and
should
be
replaced
with

These
caches
(
of
various
names
typically
ending
with
workspace
)
contain
state
to
be
shared
between
task

.
Use

Tooltool
invocations
should
use
this
cache
.
Tooltool
will
store
files
here
indexed
by
their
hash
and
will
verify
hashes
before
copying
files
from
this
directory
so
there
is
no
concern
with
sharing
the
cache
between
jobs
of
different
levels
.
