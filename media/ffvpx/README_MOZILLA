This
directory
contains
files
used
in
gecko
builds
from
FFmpeg
(

)
.
The
current
files
are
from
v2
.
8
.
2
of
the
library
.
All
source
files
match
their
path
from
the
library
'
s
source
archive
.
Currently
we
only
use
the
vp8
and
vp9
portion
of
the
library
and
only
on
x86
based
platforms
.
If
this
changes
configuration
files
will
most
likely
need
to
be
updated
.
The
configuration
files
were
generated
using
FFmpeg

s
