The
remote
agent
has
unit
-
and
functional
tests
located
under
remote
/
test
/
{
unit
browser
}
.
You
may
run
all
the
tests
under
a
particular
subfolder
like
this
:

Because
tests
are
run
in
parallel
and
[
xpcshell
]
itself
is
quite
chatty
it
can
sometimes
be
useful
to
run
the
tests
in
sequence
:
%

xcpshell

sequential
remote
/
test
/
unit
/
test_Assert
.

The
unit
tests
will
appear
as
part
of
the
X
(
for
_xpcshell_
)
jobs
on
Treeherder
