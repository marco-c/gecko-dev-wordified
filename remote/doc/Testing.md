The
remote
agent
has
a
set
of
[
xpcshell
]
unit
tests
located
in
_remote
/
test
/
unit_
.
These
can
be
run
this
way
:
%
.
/
mach
test
remote
/
test
/
unit
Because
tests
are
run
in
parallel
and
xpcshell
itself
is
quite
chatty
it
can
sometimes
be
useful
to
run
the
tests
in
sequence
:
%
.
/
mach
test
-
-
sequential
remote
/
test
/
unit
/
test_Assert
.
js
The
unit
tests
will
appear
as
part
of
the
X
jobs
on
Treeherder
.
