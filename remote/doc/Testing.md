Testing
The
Remote
Protocol
has
unit
-
and
functional
tests
located
under
different
folders
:
*
Marionette
:
remote
/
marionette
/
.
*
Shared
Modules
:
remote
/
shared
/
*
WebDriver
BiDi
:
remote
/
webdriver
-
bidi
/
You
may
want
to
run
all
the
tests
under
a
particular
subfolder
locally
like
this
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
test
remote
#
#
Unit
tests
Because
tests
are
run
in
parallel
and
[
xpcshell
]
itself
is
quite
chatty
it
can
sometimes
be
useful
to
run
the
tests
in
sequence
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
xpcshell
-
test
-
-
sequential
remote
/
shared
/
test
/
xpcshell
The
unit
tests
will
appear
as
part
of
the
X
(
for
_xpcshell_
)
jobs
on
Treeherder
.

Browser
Chrome
Mochitests
We
also
have
a
set
of
functional
browser
-
chrome
mochitests
located
under
several
components
ie
.
_remote
/
shared
/
messagehandler
/
test
/
browser_
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
mochitest
remote
/
shared
/
messagehandler
/
test
/
browser
/
browser_
*
The
functional
tests
will
appear
under
the
M
(
for
_mochitest_
)
category
in
the
remote
jobs
on
Treeherder
.
As
the
functional
tests
will
sporadically
pop
up
new
Firefox
application
windows
a
helpful
tip
is
to
run
them
in
headless
mode
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
headless
remote
/
shared
/
messagehandler
/
test
/
browser
The
-
-
headless
flag
is
equivalent
to
setting
the
MOZ_HEADLESS
environment
variable
.
You
can
additionally
use
MOZ_HEADLESS_WIDTH
and
MOZ_HEADLESS_HEIGHT
to
control
the
dimensions
of
the
virtual
display
.
The
add_task
(
)
function
used
for
writing
asynchronous
tests
is
replaced
to
provide
some
additional
test
setup
and
teardown
useful
for
writing
tests
against
the
Remote
Agent
and
the
targets
.
#
#
Puppeteer
tests
In
addition
to
our
own
Firefox
-
specific
tests
we
run
the
upstream
[
Puppeteer
test
suite
]
against
our
implementation
to
[
track
progress
]
towards
achieving
full
[
Puppeteer
support
]
in
Firefox
when
using
the
WebDriver
BiDi
protocol
.
The
tests
are
written
in
the
behavior
-
driven
testing
framework
[
Mocha
]
.
Puppeteer
tests
are
vendored
under
_remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
/
_
and
are
run
locally
like
this
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
puppeteer
-
test
You
can
also
run
them
against
Chrome
as
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
puppeteer
-
test
-
-
product
=
chrome
By
default
the
mach
command
will
automatically
install
Puppeteer
but
that
'
s
only
needed
for
the
very
first
time
or
when
a
new
Puppeteer
release
has
been
vendored
in
.
To
skip
the
install
step
use
the
-
-
no
-
install
option
.
To
run
only
some
specific
tests
from
the
whole
test
suite
the
appropriate
test
files
have
to
be
updated
first
.
To
select
specific
tests
or
test
groups
within
a
file
define
[
exclusive
tests
]
by
adding
the
.
only
suffix
like
it
.
only
(
)
or
describe
.
only
(
)
.
It
is
also
possible
similar
to
how
it
works
in
CI
to
run
tests
in
chunks
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
puppeteer
-
test
-
-
this
-
chunk
=
1
-
-
total
-
chunks
=
2
More
customizations
for
[
Mocha
]
can
be
found
in
its
own
documentation
.
Test
expectation
metadata
is
collected
in
[
TestExpectations
.
json
]
via
log
parsing
and
a
custom
Mocha
reporter
under
_remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
/
json
-
mocha
-
reporter
.
js_
.
For
Nightly
overrides
to
these
expectations
are
stored
in
[
CanaryTestExpectations
.
json
]
.
Check
the
upstream
[
Puppeteer
test
suite
]
documentation
for
instructions
on
how
to
skip
tests
run
only
one
test
or
a
subsuite
of
tests
.
