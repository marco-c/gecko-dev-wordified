#
Vendoring
Puppeteer
As
mentioned
in
the
chapter
on
[
Testing
]
we
run
the
full
[
Puppeteer
test
suite
]
on
try
.
These
tests
are
vendored
in
central
under
_remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
/
_
and
we
have
a
script
to
pull
in
upstream
changes
.
We
periodically
perform
a
manual
two
-
way
sync
.
Below
is
an
outline
of
the
process
interspersed
with
some
tips
.
#
#
Check
for
not
-
yet
upstreamed
changes
Before
vendoring
a
new
Puppeteer
release
make
sure
that
there
are
no
Puppeteer
specific
changes
in
mozilla
-
central
repository
that
haven
'
t
been
upstreamed
yet
since
the
last
vendor
happened
.
Run
one
of
the
following
commands
and
check
the
listed
bugs
or
related
upstream
code
to
verify
:
shell
%
hg
log
remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
%
git
log
remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
If
an
upstream
pull
request
is
needed
please
see
their
[
contributing
.
md
]
.
Typically
the
changes
we
push
to
Puppeteer
include
unskipping
newly
passing
unit
tests
for
Firefox
along
with
minor
fixes
to
the
tests
or
to
Firefox
-
specific
browser
-
fetching
and
launch
code
.
Be
sure
to
[
run
tests
against
both
Chromium
and
Firefox
]
in
the
Puppeteer
repo
.
You
can
specify
your
local
Firefox
build
when
you
do
so
:
shell
%
BINARY
=
<
path
-
to
-
objdir
-
binary
>
npm
run
test
:
firefox
%
BINARY
=
<
path
-
to
-
objdir
-
binary
>
npm
run
test
:
firefox
:
bidi
#
#
Prepare
the
Puppeteer
Repository
Clone
the
Puppeteer
git
repository
and
checkout
the
release
tag
you
want
to
vendor
into
mozilla
-
central
.
shell
%
git
checkout
tags
/
puppeteer
-
%
version
%
You
might
want
to
[
install
the
project
]
at
this
point
and
make
sure
unit
tests
pass
.
Check
the
project
'
s
package
.
json
for
relevant
testing
commands
.
#
#
Update
the
Puppeteer
code
in
mozilla
-
central
You
can
run
the
following
mach
command
to
copy
over
the
Puppeteer
branch
you
just
prepared
.
The
mach
command
has
flags
to
specify
a
local
or
remote
repository
as
well
as
a
commit
:
shell
%
.
/
mach
remote
vendor
-
puppeteer
-
-
commitish
puppeteer
-
%
version
%
[
-
-
repository
%
path
%
]
By
default
this
command
also
installs
the
newly
-
pulled
Puppeteer
package
in
order
to
generate
a
new
package
-
lock
.
json
file
for
the
purpose
of
pinning
Puppeteer
dependencies
for
our
CI
.
There
is
a
-
-
no
-
install
option
if
you
want
to
skip
this
step
;
for
example
if
you
want
to
run
installation
separately
at
a
later
point
.
Validate
that
newly
created
files
and
folders
are
required
to
be
tracked
by
version
control
.
If
that
is
not
the
case
then
update
both
the
top
-
level
.
hgignore
and
remote
/
.
gitignore
files
for
those
paths
.
#
#
#
Apply
recurring
patches
Due
to
some
discrepancies
between
mozilla
-
central
and
the
upstream
puppeteer
repository
some
patches
need
to
be
manually
applied
every
time
we
vendor
a
new
version
.
All
patches
should
be
located
under
remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
-
patches
and
can
be
applied
with
git
apply

Validate
that
the

code
works
Use
.
/
mach
puppeteer
-
test
(
see
[
Testing
]
)
to
run
Puppeteer
tests
against
both
Chromium
and
Firefox
in
headless
mode
.
Again
only
running
a
subset
of
tests
against
Firefox
is
fine
-
-
at
this
point
you
just
want
to
check
that
the
typescript
compiles
and
the
browser
binaries
are
launched
successfully
.
If
something
at
this
stage
fails
you
might
want
to
check
changes
in
remote
/
test
/
puppeteer
/
package
.
json
and
update
remote
/
mach_commands
.
py
with
new
npm
scripts
.
#
#
#
Verify
the
expectation
meta
data
Next
you
want
to
make
sure
that
the
expectation
meta
data
is
correct
.
Check
changes
in
[
TestExpectations
.
json
]
.
If
there
are
newly
skipped
tests
for
Firefox
you
might
need
to
update
these
expectations
.
To
do
this
run
the
Puppeteer
test
job
on
try
(
see
[
Testing
]
)
.
If
these
tests
are
specific
for
Chrome
or
time
out
we
want
to
keep
them
skipped
if
they
fail
we
want
to
have
FAIL
status
for
all
platforms
in
the
expectation
meta
data
.
You
can
see
if
the
meta
data
needs
to
be
updated
at
the
end
of
the
log
file
.
Examine
the
job
logs
and
make
sure
the
run
didn
'
t
get
interrupted
early
by
a
crash
or
a
hang
especially
if
you
see
a
lot
of
TEST
-
UNEXPECTED
-
MISSING
in
the
Treeherder
Failure
Summary
.
You
might
have
to
fix
some
new
bug
in
the
unit
tests
.
This
is
the
fun
part
.
Some
tests
can
also
unexpectedly
pass
.
Make
sure
it
'
s
correct
and
if
needed
update
the
expectation
data
by
following
the
instructions
at
the
end
of
the
log
file
.
#
#
#
Submit
the
code
changes
Once
you
are
happy
with
the
metadata
and
are
ready
to
submit
the
sync
patch
up
for
review
run
the
Puppeteer
test
job
on
try
again
with

-
rebuild

to
check
for
stability
