Remote
Protocol
The
Firefox
Remote
Protocol
is
a
low
-
level
debugging
interface
.
With
it
you
can
inspect
the
state
and
control
execution
of
documents
running
in
web
content
instrument
Gecko
in
interesting
ways
simulate
user
interaction
for
automation
purposes
and
debug
JavaScript
execution
.
Available
and
supported
protocols
are
:
*
WebDriver
classic
(
aka
Marionette
)
*
WebDriver
BiDi

Puppeteer
Puppeteer
is
a
Node
library
which
provides
a
high
-
level
API
to
control
Chrome
Chromium
and
Firefox
over
the
WebDriver
BiDi
or
CDP
protocol
.
Puppeteer
runs
headless
by
default
but
can
be
configured
to
run
full
(
non
-
headless
)
browsers
.
To
verify
that
our
implementation
of
the
WebDriver
BiDi
protocol
is
valid
we
do
not
only
run
xpcshell
browser
-
chrome
mochitests
and
web
-
platform
tests
in
Firefox
CI
but
also
the
Puppeteer
unit
tests
.
#
#
#
Expectation
Data
With
the
tests
coming
from
upstream
it
is
not
guaranteed
that
they
all
pass
in
Gecko
-
based
browsers
.
For
this
reason
it
is
necessary
to
provide
metadata
about
the
expected
results
of
each
test
.
This
is
provided
in
a
manifest
file
under
test
/
puppeteer
/
test
/
TestExpectations
.
json
.
For
each
non
-
passing
test
of
the
Puppeteer
unit
test
suite
an
equivalent
entry
will
exist
in
this
manifest
file
.
By
default
tests
are
expected
to
PASS
.
Tests
that
are
intermittent
may
be
marked
with
multiple
statuses
using
a
list
of
possibilities
e
.
g
.
for
a
test
that
usually
passes
but
intermittently
fails

"
:

"
:
[
"
PASS
"
"
FAIL
"
]
]
#
#
#
Disabling
Tests
Tests
are
disabled
when
marked
as
SKIP
in
the
manifest
file
.
For
example
if
a
test
is
unstable
it
can
be
disabled
:
"

Page
.
workers
(
worker
.
spec
.
ts
)
"
:
[
"
expectations
"
:
[
"
SKIP
"
]
]
For
intermittents
it
'
s
generally
preferable
to
give
the
test
multiple
expectations
rather
than
disable
it
.
#
#
#
Autogenerating
Expectation
Data
After
changing
some
code
it
may
be
necessary
to
update
the
expectation
data
for
the
relevant
tests
.
This
can
of
course
be
done
manually
but
mach
is
able
to
automate
the
process
:
mach
puppeteer
-
test
-
-
write
-
results
By
default
it
writes
the
output
to
test
/
puppeteer
/
test
/
TestExpectations
.
json
.
Given
that
the
unit
tests
run
in
Firefox
CI
only
for
Linux
it
is
advised
to
download
the
expectation
data
(
available
as
artifact
)
from
the
TaskCluster
job
.
