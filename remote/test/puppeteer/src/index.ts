Has
to
be
CJS
here
rather
than
ESM
such
that
the
output
file
ends
with
*
module
.
exports
=
puppeteer
.
*
*
If
this
was
export
default
puppeteer
the
output
would
be
:
*
exports
.
default
=
puppeteer
*
And
therefore
consuming
via
require
(
'
puppeteer
'
)
would
break
/
require
the
user

to
access
require
(
