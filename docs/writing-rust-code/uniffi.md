Generating
Javascript
bindings
with
UniFFI
Firefox

generating
JS
bindings
for
Rust
components
using
[
UniFFI
]
(

#
How
it
works
The
Rust
crate
contains
a
[
UniFFI
Definition
Language
(
UDL
)
file
]
(
https
:
/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
uniffi
-
rs
/
udl_file_spec
.
html
)
which
describes
the
interface
to
generate
bindings
for
.
The
UniFFI
core
generates
the
scaffolding
:
Rust
code
which
acts
as
the
FFI
layer
from
the
UDL
file
.
The
functions
of
this
layer
all
use
the
C
calling
convention
and
all
structs
use
a
C
layout
this
is
the
de
facto
standard
for
FFI
interoperability
.
The
[

mozilla

toolkit
/
components
/
uniffi

bindgen
-

-
js
)
tool
which
lives
in
the
Firefox
source
tree
generates
2
things
:
-
A
JS
interface
for
the
scaffolding
code
which
uses
[
WebIDL
]
(
/
dom
/
bindings
/
webidl
/
index
.
rst
)
-
A
JSM
module
that
uses
the
scaffolding
to
provide
the
bindings
API
.
Currently
this
generated
code
gets
checked
in
to
source
control
.
We
are
working
on
a
system
to
avoid
this
and
auto
-
generate
it
at
build
time
instead

Before
creating
new
bindings
with
UniFFI
Keep
a
few
things
in
mind
before
you
create
a
new
set
of
bindings
:
-
*
*
UniFFI
was
not
written
to
maximize
performance
.
*
*
It
'
s
code
is
efficient
enough
to
handle
many
use
cases
but
at
this
point
should
probably
be
avoided
for
performance
critical
components
.
-
*
*
uniffi
-
bindgen
-
gecko
-
js
bindings
run
with
chrome
privileges
.
*
*
Make
sure
this
is
acceptable
for
your
project
-
*
*
Only
a
subset
of
Rust
types
can
be
exposed
via
the
FFI
.
*
*
Check
the
[
UniFFI
Book
]
(
https
:
/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
uniffi
-
rs
/
)
to
see
what
types
are
compatible
with
UniFFI
.
If
any
of
these
are
blockers
for
your
work
consider
discussing
it
further
with
the
UniFFI
devs
to
see
if
we
can
support
your
project

Chat

Creating
new
bindings
with
UniFFI
Here
'
s
how
you
can
create
a
new
set
of
bindings
using
UniFFI
:
-
UniFFI
your
crate
(
if
it
isn
'
t
already
)
:
-
[
Create
a
UDL
file
to
describe
your
interface
]
(
https
:
/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
uniffi
-
rs
/
udl_file_spec
.
html
)
-
[
Set
up
your
Rust
crate
to
generate
scaffolding
]
(
https
:
/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
uniffi
-
rs
/
tutorial
/
Rust_scaffolding
.
html
)
-
Add
your
crate
as
a
Firefox
dependency
(
if
it
isn
'
t
already
)
-
If
the
code
will
exist
in
the
mozilla
-
central
repo
:
-
Create
a
new
directory
for
the
Rust
crate
-
Edit
toolkit
/
library
/
rust
/
shared
/
Cargo
.
toml
and
add
a
dependency
to
your
library
path
-
If
the
code
exists
in
an
external
repo
:
-
Edit
toolkit
/
library
/
rust
/
shared
/
Cargo
.
toml
and
add
a
dependency
to
your
library
URL
-
Run
mach
vendor
rust
to
vendor
in
your
Rust
code
-
Generate
bindings
code
for
your
crate
-
TODO
:
create
a
system
for
this
and
document
it
here
.
I
think
we
can
do
something
like
we
do
for
the
test
fixtures
where
devs
don
'
t
need
to
touch
that
many
moz
.
build
files
.
