TypeScript
In
firefox
-
main
we
are
introducing
the
use
of
[
TypeScript
]
(
https
:
/
/
www
.
typescriptlang
.
org
/
)
to
help
provide
type
autocompletion
static
analysis
and
type
checking
of
our
JavaScript
code
.
:
:
:
{
note
}
At
the
moment
we
are
in
the
bootstrap
/
experimentation
phase
there
are
various
parts
of
infrastructure
that
have
not
yet
been
created
and
incomplete
type
definitions
which
may
cause
issues
for
projects
.
Hence
TypeScript
is
not
recommended
for
all
projects
for
the
time
being
.
We
are
currently
prioritising
enabling
type
autocompletion
across
the
code
base
before
we
proceed
to
more
work
on
type
checking
.
You
can
work
towards
enabling
TypeScript
by
ensuring
your
code
passes
the
[
ESLint
jsdoc
rules
]
(
https
:
/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
firefox
-
main
/
search
?
q
=
jsdoc
%
2F
&
path
=
eslint
-
plugin
-
mozilla
%
2Flib
%
2Fconfigs
&
case
=
false
&
regexp
=
false
)
.
If
you
are
interested
please
ask
in
the
Lint
and
Formatting
channel
(

Where
TypeScript
is
Currently
Enabled
TypeScript
is
currently
only
enabled
on
a
[
limited
set
of
directories
]

Running
TypeScript
Locally
The
TypeScript
linter
may
be
run
on
the
directories
where
it
is
enabled
using
:
.
/
mach
lint
-
l
typescript
path
/
to
/
file

(
or
to

Updating
Gecko
Type
Definitions
Updating
types
currently
happens
manually
although
[
we
are
in
the
process
of
automating
it

.
In
the
meantime
developers
using
TypeScript
must
update
the
type
definitions
[
manually
using
some
scripts

Frequently
Asked
Questions
*
Why
does
running
TypeScript
check
and
report
errors
in
other
files
?
*
Changes
in
one
file
may
impact
on
another
and
TypeScript
can
detect
this
.
*
Additionally
the
way
that
TypeScript
works
means
that
it
will
run
across
the
whole
project
regardless
so
we
report
all
the
issues
that
it
reports
.
*
Will
my
patches
get
backed
out
due
to
TypeScript
failures
?
*
Currently
no
.
Whilst
we
have
a
[
TypeScript
Linter
on
CI
]
(
.
.
/
lint
/
linters
/
typescript
.
rst
)
it
is
currently
tier
-
3
which
is
hidden
from
the
sheriffs
view
.
*
Failures
will
however
be
reported
on
reviews
on
Phabricator
.
*
We
will
promote
the
linter
to
tier
-
2
and
tier
-
1
once
we
have
more
automation
in
place
for
type
generation
.
*
Why
isn
'
t
this
being
encouraged
for
everyone
?
*
As
discussed
in
the
note
at
the
top
of
the
page
we
are
still
in
the
set
-
up
and
experimentation
phase
.
There
is
a
lot
of
infrastructure
that
is
required
to
make
TypeScript
usable
on
a
day
to
day
basis
.
*
Are
we
planning
to
allow
using
TypeScript
files
and
compiling
directly
from
TypeScript
?
*
No
.
In
the
past
we
'
ve
worked
to
avoid
processing
or
compilation
steps
wherever
possible
when
developing
JavaScript
.
This
helps
to
reduce
code
-
test
cycle
times
and
make
debugging
simpler
.
*
Whilst
it
is
possible
we
could
change
the
approach
in
future
it
is
not
an
objective
of
enabling
TypeScript
over
the
firefox
-
main
code
base
.
*
Something
isn
'
t
working
as
I
would
expect
where
should
I
look
/
ask
?
*

have
a

for
TypeScript
issues
in

We
work
through
them
over
time
though
we
appreciate
help
as
well

Further
Reading

The
[
TypeScript
documentation
]
(

)
is
very
useful
in
understanding
how
TypeScript
works
and
how
types
may
be
set
up
.

The
[
