This
linter
checks
for
unused
mfbt
headers
across
the
code
base
.
It
is
preprocessor
-
agnostic
and
mostly
language
-
agnostic
.
It
should
have
no
false
positive
and
allows
for
false
negative
.
Principle
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
This
linter
works
by
looking
for
mfbt
headers
included
in
any
C
Objective
-
C
or
C
+
+
file
.
For
each
of
this
header
it
consults
an
abstract
API
description
file
and
checks
if
any
symbol
(
be
it
macro
function
global
variable
type
definition
operator
)
described
in
the
API
is
actually
used
in
the
source
.
If
not
it
reports
the
error
.
The
lookup
for
symbol
is
textual
which
makes
it
very
fast
(
no
build
required
)
preprocessor
-
agnostic
(
all
configuration
are
honored
no
header
generation
required
)
at
the
expense
of
including
comments
etc
.

It
is
basically
a
mapping
from
header
name
to
a
set
of
symbols
classified
by
type
(
macro
function
etc
)
.
The
symbols
are
named
independently
of
their
namespace
or
argument
type
.
Any
symbol
that
is
not
be
used
by
third
-
party
(
e
.
g
.
from
the
detail
namespace
or
some
auxiliary
macro
)
should
not
be
listed
.
Some
checks
are
done
to
avoid
it
from
getting
out

of

they
are
performed
