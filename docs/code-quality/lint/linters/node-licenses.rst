If
the
linter
raises
an
issue
with
a
license
the
license
should
be
checked
against
the
Runbook
and
if
necessary
consult
with
the
Legal
team
to
ensure
it
is
acceptable
.
Dependencies
with
unaccepted
licenses
must
not
be
committed
into
the
repository
.
If
this
linter
fails
it
will
cause
your
changes
to
be
backed
out
.
New
licenses
that
have
been
accepted
by
Legal
may
be
added
to
the

There
is
also
a
specific
section
in
the
configuration
file
known
-
packages
where
a
package
may
be
specified
if
Legal
has
accepted
the
use
of
that
package
but
is
not
willing
to
allow
the
license
generally
