For

spawn
and
SpecialPowers
.
spawnChrome
calls
this
will
automatically
declare
the
frame
script
variables
in
the
global
scope
.
By
default
the
configs
only
specify
it
for
the
mochitest
based
configurations
.
Note
:
due
to
the
way
ESLint
works
it
appears
it
is
only
easy
to
declare
these
variables
on
a
file
global
scope
rather
than
function
global
.
This
may
mean
that
they
are
incorrectly
allowed
but
given
they
are
test
files
this
should
be
detected
during
testing
.
