describes
the

for
developers
working
with
this

uniffi
-
bindgen
-
gecko
-
js
is
the
first
bindings
generator
to
adopt
this
code
although
we
hope
to
eventually
move
all
bindings
to
this
system
.
This
means
the
uniffi
-
bindgen
-
gecko
-
js
code
may
look
different
than
other
bindings
but
we
hope
it
'
s
only
temporary
