for
each
callback
interface
.
This
stores
the
callback
interface
implementations
that
are
manually
written
by
Firefox
engineers
.
These
are
stored
in
a
map
where
the
key
is
an
integer
handle
for
the
callback
interface
.
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
callAsync
is
used
by
the
C
+
+
layer
to
invoke
callback
interface
methods
.
See
below
for
why
we
only
currently
have
callAsync
(
)
.
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
callAsync
(
)
inputs
:
*
The
object
handle
*
The
method
index
*
Each
argument
for
the
callback
method
after
being
lowered
by
JavaScript
.
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
callAsync
(
)
returns
a
UniFFIScaffoldingCallResult
.
Like
with
[
Rust
calls
]
(
.
/
rust
-
calls
.
md
)
this
is
a
UniffiCallStatus
combined
with
a
return
value
.
For
each
callback
interface
the
JavaScript
layer
calls
UniFFIScaffolding
.
registerCallbackHandler
(
)
with
the
UniFFICallbackHandler
for
that
interface
.
Like
with
Rust
calls
the
bindings
code
generates
a
unique
ID
to
identify
each
callback
interface
.
#
#
C
+
+
layer
The
C
+
+
layer
acts
as
a
bridge
between
the
generated
Rust
code
and
the
generated
JavaScript
code
.
It
registers
a
vtable
with
the
Rust
code
where
each
field
points
to
a
generated
C
function
that
:
*
Looks
up
the
UniFFICallbackHandler
registered
with
UniFFIScaffolding
.
registerCallbackHandler
(
)
*
Lifts
all
passed
arguments
and
passes
them
to
the
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
*
For
fire
-
and
-
forget
calls
:
*
Calls
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
callAsync
(
)
with
the
lifted
arguments
then
discards
the
returned
Promise
.
*
Note
:
sync
calls
are
currently
always
wrapped
to
be
"
fire
-
and
-
forget
"
callbacks
*
For
async
calls
:
*
Calls
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
callAsync
(
)
with
the
lifted
arguments
getting
back
a
Promise
object
.
*
Appends
a
[
PromiseNativeHandler
]
(

/
searchfox
.

/
mozilla
-
central
/
source
/
dom
/
promise
/
PromiseNativeHandler
.
h
)
to
promise
object
.
*
The
PromiseNativeHandler
completes
the
promise
by
calling
the
complete
callback
as
described
in
the
[
UniFFI
FFI
internals
doc
]
(

with

complete_func
)
.
*
The
PromiseNativeHandler
also
has
code
to
handle
a
rejected
promise
by
calling
the
complete
callback
with
RustCallStatusCode
:
:
UnexpectedError
.
#
#
Freeing
Callback
Interface
Objects
Each
VTable
also
has
a
uniffi_free
method
.
When
the
Rust
code
drops
the
callback
interface
object
the
generated
UniFFI
code
arranges
for
uniffi_free
to
be
called
.
When
this
happens
the
C
+
+
generated
function
calls
UniFFICallbackHandler
.
destroy
(
)
.
The
generated
JavaScript
handles
that
by
removing
the
entry
from
the
callback
interface
map
.
