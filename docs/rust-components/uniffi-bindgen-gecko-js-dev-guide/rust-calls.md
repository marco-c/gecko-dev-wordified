Sync
Rust
calls
*
The
generated
JavaScript
code
calls
[
UniffiScaffolding
.
callSync
(
)
]
(

webidl
)
.
*
The
first
argument
to
callSync
(
)
is
a
numeric
identifier
for
the
FFI
call
known
to
both
the
JavaScript
and
C
+
+
code
generators
.
*
That
is
followed
by
lowered
argument
from
the
JavaScript
call
.
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
then
performs
the
second
phase
of
argument
lowering
and
makes
the
Rust
call
.
This
code
is
statically
linked
to
the
Rust
code
so
it
can
make
this
call
directly
.
*
The
C
+
+
code
then
returns
a
UniFFIScaffoldingCallResult
to
the
JavaScript
code
which
is
essentially
a
UniffiCallStatus
plus
a
return
value
.
*
The
generated
JavaScript
code
inspects
the
UniFFIScaffoldingCallResult
and
either
returns
a
value
or
raises
an
exception
.
#
#
Wrapped
-
async
calls
*
UniffiScaffolding
.
callAsyncWrapper
is
called
instead
of
UniffiScaffolding
.
callSync
.
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
schedules
the
Rust
call
in
a
worker
thread
.
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
returns
a
Promise
to
JavaScript
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
resolves
that
promise
using
the
returned
Rust
value
.
*
The
C
+
+
code
resolves
the
promise
with
a
UniFFIScaffoldingCallResult
value
.
#
#
Async
calls
*
Use
UniffiScaffolding
.
callAsync
(
)
is
used
to
make
the
Rust
call
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
returns
a
Promise
to
JavaScript
*
The
generated
C
+
+
code
implements
the
future
callback
and
polls
the
Rust
function
as
described
in
the
[
UniFFI
async
overview
]

.
*
Once
the
Rust
future
is
complete
the
C
+
+
code
resolves
the
JavaScript
promise
with
the
result
*
The
C
+
+
code
resolves
the
promise
with
a
UniFFIScaffoldingCallResult
value
.
Note
:
The
generated
code
does
not
handle
cancellation
or
the
foreign_future_dropped_callback
.
In
JavaScript
once
an
async
task
has
started
running
there
'
s
no
way
to
force
it
to
stop
.
Other
JavaScript
bindings
have
handled
this
by
passing
an
[
Abort
Controller
]
(

/
developer

mozilla
.

/

/
docs
/
Web
/
API
/
AbortController
)
as
an
extra
argument
to
async
functions
maybe
we
could
also
do
this
in
the
future
.
