The
JS
and
C
+
+
layers
uniffi
-
bindgen
-
gecko
-
js
is
split
into
2
layers
:
JavaScript
and
C
+
+
.
The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
JavaScript
doesn
'
t
have
a
way
of
calling
the
Rust
FFI
functions
.
On
Kotlin
we
can
use
JNA
and
on
Python
we
can
use
ctypes
but
there
'
s
nothing
equivalent
in
JavaScript
.
(
technically
there
is
the
js
-
ctypes
library
however
this
has
been
deprecated
for
a
long
time
)
.
The
C
+
+
layer
provides
the
JavaScript
layer
with
a
way
to
call
the
Rust
FFI
functions
.
This
can
be
thought
of
as
a
ctypes
library
specialized
for
UniFFI
.
In
many
ways
it
does
less
than
ctypes
for
example
can
only
call
UniFFI
-
generated
FFI
functions
.
In
some
ways
however
it
does
more
for
example
much
of
the
async
logic
is
built
in
to
the
C
+
+
code
.
#
#
UniFFI
.
webidl
and
WebIDL
code
generation
The
interface
between
the
C
+
+
and
JavaScript
code
is
defined
in
[
UniFFI
.
webidl
]
(

searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
source
/
dom
/
chrome
-
webidl
/
UniFFI
.
webidl
)
.
This
brings
a
second
system
of
code
generation
which
auto
-
generates
the
C
+
+
glue
code
needed
to
expose
this
interface
to
JavaScript
.

[
Web
IDL
bindings

for
details
.
Two
different
code
-
generators
can
be
a
bit
mind
-
bending
but
the
high
-
level
view
is
relatively
simple
.
The
C
+
+
code
needs
to
implement
the
interface
defined
in
UniFFI
.
webidl
.
The
JavaScript
code
uses
that
interface
to
handle
the
low
-
level
FFI
details
.
The
JavaScript
code
mostly
looks
like
normal
UniFFI
bindings
while
the
C
+
+
code
is
very
unique
to
uniffi
-
bindgen
-
gecko
-
js
.
