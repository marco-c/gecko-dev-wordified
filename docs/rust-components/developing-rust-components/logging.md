#
Logging
#
#
Rust
code
Make
sure
to
use
the
logging
macros
from
the
tracing_support
crate
(
tracing_support
:
:
debug
!
tracing_support
:
:
info
!
etc
)
.
error_support
also
contains
a
copy
of
the
same
macros
which
can
be
a
more
convenient
import
for
components
that
already
depend
on
error_support
.

Forwarding
logs
to
the
browser
console
Rust
logs
can
be
forwarded
to
the
JavaScript
browser
console
using
the
toolkit
.
rust
-
components
.
logging
.
crates
pref
.
This
pref
stores
a
comma
-
separated
list
of
items
where
each
item
is
a
logging
target
and
an
optional
logging
level
.
Each
item
in
the
comma
separated
list
can
be
:
*
A
tracing
level
(
error
warn
info
debug
trace
)
.
This
will
forward
all
events
with
that
level
or
greater
.
*
A
target
plus
tracing
level
(
e
.
g
.
logins
:
warn
)
This
will
forward
all
events
for
that
target
with
that
level
or
greater
.
"
target
"
here
means
crate
name
unless
the
crate
specifically
sets
a
target
which
is
rare
.
*
A
bare
target
(
e
.
g
.
logins
)
.
This
will
forward
all
events
for
that
target
that
are
debug
or
higher
.
For
example
logins
autofill
:
warn
error
suggest
would
forward
:
-
Logins
logs
at
the
debug
level
-
Autofill
logs
at
the
warning
level
-
Suggest
logs
at
the
debug
level
-
All
other
logs
at
the
error
level
.
#
#
#
Error
reporting
Errors
from
the
error
reporter
have
level
error
so
they
will
be
forwarded
to
the
browser
console
by
default
.
Add
the
app
-

-
error
-
reporter
target
to
get
breadcrumbs
forwarded
as
well
.

setupLoggerForTarget
An
alternative
logging
mechanism
is
setupLoggerForTarget
.
This
allows
you
to
connect
tracing
events
to
the
Log
.
sys
.
mjs
logger
.
The
main
reason
to
do
this
is
to
connect
to
an
existing
logger
like
the
Sync
logger
.

At
the

Logs
on
Android
On
android
logs
currently
go
to
logcat
.
Android
Studio
can
be
used
to
view
the
logcat
logs
;
connect
the
device
over
USB
and
view
the
Logcat
tab
at
the
bottom
of
Android
Studio
.
Check
to
make
sure
you
have
the
right
device
selected
at
the
top
left
of
the
Logcat
pane
and
the
correct
process
to
the
right
of
that
.
One
trick
to
avoid
having
to
select
the
correct
process
(
as
there
are
main
and
content
processes
)
is
to
choose
"
No
Filters
"
from
the
menu
on
the
top
right
of
the
Logcat
pane
.
Then
use
the
search
box
to
search
for
the
log
messages
you
are
trying
to
find
.
There
are
also
many
other
utilities
command
line
and
graphical
that
can
be
used
to
view
logcat
logs
from
a
connected
android
device
in
a
more
flexible
manner
.
