Releasing

Firefox

does
not

i

e
.
writes
that
happen
during
shutdown
.
This
is
a
particular
concern
to
any
component
that
holds
an
SQLite
database
.
If
they
are
garbage
collected
at
shutdown
with
the
database
still
open
then
SQLite
will
write
to
disk
when
it
closes
its
connection
triggering
a
late
write
error
.
The
typical
way
to
avoid
this
is
to
have
a
shutdown
method
which
closes
all
resources
.
The
JS
code
then
adds
a
profile
-
before
-
change
shutdown
blocker
which
calls
shutdown
(
)
.

64

bit
integers
The
JS
number
type
can
only
store
53
bit
integer
values
safely
.
If
you
have
a
u64
or
i64
Rust
value
make
sure
to
only
use
values
between
[
Number
.
MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
]

.
Values
outside

result

#
#
Callback
/
trait
interfaces
and
reference
cycles
Callback
interfaces
should
avoid
storing
UniFFI
objects
since
this
can
create
a
reference
cycle
that
will
never
be
broken
.
For
example
component
A
stores
reference
to
a
callback
interface
B
and
B
stores
a
reference
to
A
.
In
this
case
there
'
s
no
way
for
the
JavaScript
garbage
collector
to
detect
the
cycle
since
it
goes
through
FFI
code
.
.
This
also
applies
to
trait
interfaces
that
have
the
with_foreign
attribute
.
There
are
several
ways
avoid
this
listed
in
order
of
preference
:
*
Prefer
callback
interfaces
that
store
no
properties
at
all
.
*
Avoid
properties
that
store
Rust
objects
.
*
Use
a
[
WeakRef
]
(

org
/
en
-
US
/
docs
/
Web
/
JavaScript
/
Reference
/
Global_Objects
/
WeakRef
)
to
store
Rust
objects
.
*
As
a
last
-
resort
use
callback
interfaces
that
store
Rust
objects
but
make
sure
you
have
a
system
to
manually
break
the
reference
cycles
.
Note
:
Reference
cycles
can
also
be
formed
in
Rust
-
only
code
using
Arc
s
so
watch
out
for
those
too
.
However
cycles
that
go
across
the
FFI
using
callback
interfaces
are
particularly
hard
to
spot
.

Implementing
trait
interfaces
in
Rust
JavaScript
callback
interfaces
can
sometimes
be
avoided
if
UniFFI

exposing

traits
-
as

interfaces
)
are
used
.
These
work
similarly
to
callback
interfaces
but
can
be
implemented
in
either
JavaScript
or
Rust
.
Firefox
Desktop
has
some
support
for
using
Rust
code
for
example
[
Rust
code
can
access
XPCOM
components

You
may
be
able
to
leverage
this
to
avoid
JavaScript
altogether
and
implementing
the
trait
in
Firefox
Desktop
Rust
code
instead
.
