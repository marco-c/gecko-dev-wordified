Firefox

Coding
Policy
This
policy
applies
to
anyone
contributing
to
the
Firefox
project
.
It
defines
expectations
and
requirements
for
any
usage
of
AI
or
AI
-
adjacent
tools
when
authoring
production
code
for
the
browser
.
These
guidelines
may
evolve
as
the
Mozilla
community
gains
experience
.
#
#
Philosophy
AI
-
assisted
tools
are
evolving
quickly
but
it
'
s
clear
that
they
present
both
opportunities
and
risks
when
used
by
developers
to
explore
understand
and
create
code
.
They
can
accelerate
work
and
help
catch
issues
earlier
but
they
also
make
it
easy
to
generate
code
that
looks
right
without
being
right
.
For
contributors
who
choose
to
use
these
tools
we
trust
them
to
do
so
with
care
just
as
we
trust
them
with
every
other
part
of
Firefox
'
s
development
.
AI
can
assist
but
responsibility
always
stays
with
the
human
behind
the
change
.
#
#
Responsibilities
AI
-
assisted
contributions
must
meet
the
same
standards
of
correctness
security
and
maintainability
as
any
other
patch
.
#
#
#
When
using
AI
tools
:
*
*
*
Maintain
quality
and
scope
.
*
*
You
are
responsible
for
the
technical
excellence
of
your
work
regardless
of
the
tools
you
used
.
Keep
patches
small
and
focused
so
they
'
re
easy
to
review
and
clearly
justified
.
*
*
*
Understand
what
you
submit
.
*
*
You
'
re
expected
to
understand
and
be
able
to
explain
every
change
you
make
.
The
role
of
the
[
reviewer
]
(
.
/
Code_Review_FAQ
.
rst
)
is
to
double
-
check
the
work
of
a
human
not
the
output
of
a
tool
.
*
*
*
Protect
sensitive
data
.
*
*
Do
not
include
private
security
-
sensitive
or
otherwise
confidential
information
in
prompts
to
external
AI
tools
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
you
are
accountable
for
all
changes
you
submit
regardless
of
the
tools
you
use
.

For
new
contributors
"
Good
First
"
and
"
Good
Next
"
bugs
exist
to
help
new
contributors
learn
the
Firefox
codebase
.
Take
these
only
if
you
intend
to
learn
and
continue
contributing
.
Fixing
a
large
number
of
these
with
AI
tools
alone
is
counterproductive
to
that
goal
.
