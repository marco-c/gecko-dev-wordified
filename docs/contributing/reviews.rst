Thorough
code
reviews
are
one
of
Mozilla
'
s
ways
of
ensuring
code
quality
.
Every
patch
must
be
reviewed
by
the
module
owner
of
the
code
or
one
of
their
designated
peers
.
To
request
a
review
you
will
need
to
specify
a
review
group
.
If
there
is
not
you
should
select
one
or
more
usernames
either
when
you
submit
the
patch
or
afterward
in
the
UI
.
If
you
have
a
mentor
the
mentor
can
usually
either
also
review
or
find
a
suitable
reviewer
on
your
behalf
.
Getting
attention
:
If
a
reviewer
doesn
'
t
respond
within
a
week
or
so
of
the
review
request
:
*
Contact
the
reviewer
directly
(
either
via
e
-
mail
or
on
Matrix
)
.
*
Join
developers
on
Mozilla
'
s
Matrix
server
<

_
and
ask
if
anyone
knows
why
a
review
may
be
delayed
.
Please
link
to
the
bug
too
.
*
If
the
review
is
still
not
addressed
mail
the
reviewer
directly
asking
if
/
when
they
'
ll
have
time
to
review
the
patch
or
might
otherwise
be
able
to
review
it
.
