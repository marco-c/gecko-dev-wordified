At

webrtc
is
a
row
of
buttons
which
allow
the

The

button
expands

This
will

In
the
event

the

issues
one
may
be
asked
to
submit

are
gathered
by
pressing
the

Delayed
media
is
commonly
caused
by
long
physical
paths
between
endpoints
though
anything
that
slows
down
inter
-
hop
delivery
of
packets
can
be
at
fault
.
Note
that
this
is
different
than
the
bandwidth
of
the
network
path
and
a
high
latency
will
not
be
fixed
by
reducing
the
video
resolution
or
audio
sample
rate
.
Round
trip
time
or
RTT
is
the
time
it
takes
for
a
packet
to
get
from
the
sender
to
the
receiver
and
then
for
a
packet
to
get
from
the
receiver
back
to
the
sender
.
If
the
path
is
symmetric
between
the
two
endpoints
one
can
assume
that
the
one
way
delay
is
half
the
delay
of
the
round
trip
.
The
second
common
cause
of
A
/
V
delay
is
jitter
the
magnitude
of
variability
in
packet
inter
-
arrival
times
.
In
order
to
smoothly
play
out
of
the
incoming
stream
a
receiver
experiencing
jitter
will
have
to
buffer
(
delay
)
incoming
packets
.

.
They
can
be
found
in
the
RTP

section
of

The

start

If

covering
dumping
unencrypted
partial
RTP
and
RTCP
packets
in
the
logs
.
While
the
information
presented
in
that
post
is
still
relevant
the
command
to
extract
the
packet
data
in
the
blog
is
out
of
date
.
A
working
method
is
presented
below
;
Using
the
gecko
logging
system
unencrypted
mangled
partial
RTP
-
packets
can
be
written
out
.
This
may
be
a
good
avenue
of
investigation
for
packet
loss
and
recovery
simulcast
and
feedback
.
Because
the
entirety
of
the
packet
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
logged
this
is
less
suitable
for
debugging
issues
with
encoded
media
.
These
logged
packets
can
be
converted
to
PCAP
files
which
can
then
be
explored
in
Wireshark
<
https
:
/
/
www
.
wireshark
.
org
/
>
__
.
The
logs
produced
by
this
module
can
be
quite
large
making
it
easy
to
identify
by
file
size
which
child
process
log
files
contain
packet
dumps
.
To
start
RTP
logging
one
must
enable
the
:
code
:
RtpLogger
log
module
.
The
:
code
:
sync
option
should
also
be
used
as
it
prevents
undesirable
interleaving
of
log
messages
.
Here
are
the
minimal
log
settings
needed
:
.
.
code
:
:
sh
MOZ_LOG
=
'
sync
RtpLogger
:
5
'
In
order
to
interpret
the
packet
contents
one
needs
to
refer
to
the
SDP
.
Wireshark
is
unaware
of
the
negotiated
details
so
it
can
not
directly
decode
the
media
nor
can
it
decode
the
header
extensions
.
The
SDP
can
also
be
logged
and
so
the
following
is
a
more
useful
set
of
log
settings
:
.
.
code
:
:
sh
MOZ_LOG
=
'
sync
RtpLogger
:
5
jsep
:
5
'
.
.
note
:
:
On
macOS
it
is
simple
to
install
Wireshark
and
text2pcap

Homebrew

When
codec
negotiation
doesn
'
t
happen
as
expected
there
are
several
helpful
locations
where
one
can
find
information
.
The
SDP
offer
and
answer
contain
the
list
of
codecs
that
were
in
the
initial
offer
and
the
subset
of
those
codecs
that
were
selected
in
the
answer
.
The
easiest
way
to
get
this
information
on
a
live
call
is
through
about
:
webrtc
.
Each
RTCPeerConnection
has
its
own
subsection
that
when
expanded
contains
an
SDP
section
.
There
are
buttons
to
display
the
offer
and
the
answer
.
Depending
on
which
party
was
the
offerer
and
which
was
the
answerer
one
may
have
a
local
offer
and
a
remote
answer
or
a
remote
offer
and
a
local
answer
.
Firefox
chooses
which
codecs
to
offer
based
on
availability
.
Some
codecs
like
Opus
or
VP8
are
always
available
.
Some
codecs
are
available
in
software
and
some
codecs
on
some
platforms
are
available
in
hardware
.
H264
support
is
provided
by
a
third
-
party
and
is
automatically
downloaded
the
first
time
its
use
is
requested
.
This
is
a
process
which
can
take
a
variable
amount
of
time
depending
on
network
circumstances
.
.
.

There
are
a
variety
of
tests
providing
coverage
over
WebRTC
related
code
.
The
Web
Platform
Suite
provides
conformance
tests
for
browsers
.
The
:
code
:
gtest
suite
is
composed
of
unit
tests
.
Crashtests
are
a
type
of
regression
test
which
are
written
to
induce
crashes
.
There
are
fuzzing
tests
which
exercise
APIs
in
ways
that
the
authors
did
not
foresee
.
All
of
the
WebRTC
tests
can
be
run
locally
with
:
code
:
mach
or
in
CI
on
Try
.
There
is
a
detailed
overview
of
all
available
test
types
including
those
not
exercised
by
WebRTC
code

maybe
an

both

warning

:
WebRTC
calls
make
use
of
a
number
of
internal

Amongst
the
behaviors
these
timers
control
are
transport
selection
bandwidth
estimation
packet
loss
determination
media
adaptation
lip
sync
connection
timeout
and
more
.
There
are
Try
targets
which
are
too
slow
to
reliably
run
a
number
of
the
tests
.
Before
running
a
specific
test
on
Try
for
the
first
time
it
may
be
best
to
check
the
relevant
test
suite
manifest
.
This
can
be
done
easily
with
Searchfox
.
org
by
searching
for
and
viewing
a
test

.
If
that
test

disabled
on

The

The
needs
of
these

did
not
align
with

testing
in

Before

one
should
consider
if

would
be
better
expressed
as
a
WPT

all
browsers
can
test

Locally
running

jitter

are
additive
in
nature

If
there
was
25ms
of
jitter
reported
and
a
RTT
of
272ms
one
could
estimate
the

delay
from

to
be

Simultaneously
sending

versions
of

SVC
(
Scalable

A
video
coding
technique
that
encodes
a

that
can
be
decoded
at
different
resolutions
frame
rates
or
quality
levels
to
adapt
to
varying
network
conditions

receiver
capabilities
.
Unlike
simulcast
which
sends

SVC
produces
one
