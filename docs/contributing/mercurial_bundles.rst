If
you
have
a
poor
network
connection
that
is
preventing
hg
clone
from
completing
you
may
want
to
try
downloading
a
bundle
of
the
repository
you
'
re
interested
in
.
This
is
useful
since
a
file
download
unlike
hg
clone
can
be
resumed
if
the
connection
is
interrupted
.
Once
you
have
the
bundle
staying
up
-
to
-
date
shouldn
'
t
take
much
time
at
all
if
you
keep
up
with
it
regularly

(
released
March
2017
)
or
later
download
the
zstd
bundle
for
the
repository
you

The
zstd
bundles
are
faster
to
download
(
smaller

and
faster

Once
you
have
downloaded
the
repository
bundle
follow
the
steps
below
to
recreate
the
repository
locally
based
upon
that
bundle
.
Be
sure
to
replace
"
mozilla
-
central
"
with
the
project
you
'
re
working
with
as
appropriate
.
1
.
Initialize
a
new
repository
(
in
a
directory
called
mozilla
-
central
here
)
:
:
:
mkdir
mozilla
-
central
hg
init
mozilla
-
central
2
.
Un
-
bundle
the
bundle
file
to
that
repository
:
To
use
the
below
command
in
Windows
export
the
\
path
\
to
\
hg
and
invoke
the
command
from
command
prompt
.
On
Ubuntu
click
on
the
properties
of
the
file
and
you
can
find
the
path
.
In
case
the
name
of
the
file
is
not
bundle
.
hg
rename
it
.
:
:
cd
mozilla
-
central
hg
unbundle
/
path
/
to
/
your
/
bundle
.
hg
Get
comfortable
.
Grab
a
coffee
(
or
your
favorite
tasty
beverage
)
.
Maybe
a
nap
.
This
unbundling
process
is
going
to
take
quite
a
lot
of
time
.
3
.
Add
the
following
lines
to
the
repository
'
s
config
file
(
.
hg
/
hgrc
)
so
that
Mercurial
will
automatically
know
where
to
pull
changes
from
future
updates
.
You
can
open
the
template
config
file
in
your
editor
by
running
hg
config
-
-
edit
or
EDITOR
=
<
editor
-
of
-
your
-
choice
>
hg
config
-
-
edit
:
:
[
paths
]
default
=
https
:
/
/
hg
.
mozilla
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
4
.
Update
the
repository
to
get
all
the
changes
since
the
bundle
was
created
(
this
step
also
doubles
as
a
check
of
the
bundle
integrity
since
if
its
contents
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
what
'
s
in
the
official
repository
then
the
hg
pull
will
fail
)
:
:
:
hg
pull
5
.
Check
out
a
working
copy
from
your
new
up
to
date
repository
:
:
:
hg
update
You
now
have
a
clone
of
mozilla
-
central
that
is
identical
to
one
made
via
hg
clone
.
