Data
Collection
Most
Firefox
features
operate
entirely
on
-
device
.
A
feature
involving
one
or
more
connections
to
a
Mozilla
server
qualifies
as
data
collection
.
Even
if
the
request
data
is
not
actually
retained
by
Mozilla
it
should
be
reviewed
as
if
it
might
be
so
that
the
privacy
properties
of
Firefox
can
be
verified
without
relying
on
retention
commitments
.
As
part
of
our
overall
[
vision
for
privacy
]
[
privacy
-
vision
]
we
hold
Firefox
to
an
unusually
high
standard
with
respect
to
handling
user
data
.
Accordingly
any
data
collection
needs
to
be
carefully
vetted
for
consistency
with
this
standard
.
Our
engineering
processes
are
designed
to
ensure
this
vetting
happens
consistently
but
browsers
are
extremely
complex
and
mistakes
can
happen
.
As
such
everyone
who
works
on
Firefox
is
responsible
for
understanding
our
rules
for
data
and
speaking
up
if
something
doesn
t
look
right
.
This
document
outlines
our
approach
and
policies
on
a
few
key
topics
.
#
#
User
Control
Users
must
be
able
to
disable
any
network
connection
from
the
client
to
Mozilla
.
Absent
a
good
reason
this
should
be
possible
as
a
supported
configuration
in
the
browser
UI
.
In
the
rare
situations
where
we
do
have
a
good
reason
not
to
offer
a
control
in
Firefox
settings
(
e
.
g
.
fetching
the
malicious

)
there
must
still
be
a

#
Browsing
Data
A
longstanding
tenet
of
Firefox
development
is
that
_even
Mozilla_
shouldn
t
be
able
to
learn
what
a
user
does
online
sites
they
visit
what
they
do
on
them
etc
.
This
is
different
from
many
other
browsers
and
internet
applications
where
the
vendor
routinely
collects
and
stores
sensitive
user
data
on
their
servers
.
Rather
than
asking
users
to
trust
Mozilla
with
this
information
Firefox
aims
to
provide
_verifiable
guarantees_
of
secrecy
:
someone
should
be
able
to
inspect
the
source
code
and
verify
that
it
is
never
revealed
in
the
first
place
.
There
are
various
edge
-
case
[
exceptions
]
(
#
exceptions
)
to
this
posture
but
that
s
the
big
picture
.
The
simplest
guarantee
is
inspectable
source
code
that
never
transmits
the
data
[
^
1
]
.
This
is
how
Firefox
handles
browsing
data
modulo
a
_very_
small
number
of
exceptions
.
Those
exceptions
are
situations
where
we
use
some
form
of
encryption
to
create
a
verifiable
guarantee
for
an
important
online
use
-
case
.
For
example
the
history
and
bookmark
sync
feature
for
Firefox
Accounts
uses
end
-
to
-
end
encryption
to
store
browsing
history
on
Mozilla
s
servers
without
Mozilla
learning
the
contents
.
The
approved
technologies
for
verifiable
guarantees
are
outlined
[
below
]
(
#
verifiable
-
guarantees
)
.
The
consequence
of
these
restrictions
on
sensitive
data
is
that
nearly
all
of
the
data
transmitted
by
Firefox
to
Mozilla
falls
into
the
not
-
particularly
-
sensitive
bucket
.
This
includes
the
data
exchanged
to
power
various
cloud
-
supported
features
(
updates
add
-
ons
push
notifications
etc
)
as
well
as
measurement
telemetry
(
described
in
the
next
section
)
.
#
#
Telemetry
and
Experiments
Firefox
contains
various
[
measurement
probes
]
[
gleandict
]
to
help
us
understand
and
improve
the
browser
loosely
known
within
Mozilla
as
Telemetry
[
^
2
]
.
This
instrumentation
is
enabled
by
default
but
can
be
disabled
during
onboarding
in
settings
or
through
various
other
mechanisms
(
e
.
g
.
enterprise
policies
)
.
Some
representative
probes
include
[
OS
version
]
[
os
-
version
-
dict
]
[
memory
usage
]
[
memory
-
dict
]
[
CSS
use
-
counters
]
[
usercounter
-
dict
]
and
[
number
of
interactions
with
the
bookmarks
bar
]
[
bookmarks
-
dict
]
.
In
addition
to
telemetry
other
measurement
probes
collect
data
on
a
more
de
-
identified
basis
for
measuring
daily
usage
numbers
and
for
some
engagement
and
attribution
purposes
.
Sitting
atop
this
infrastructure
is
an
optional
experimentation
system
.
This
allows
us
to
deploy
features
to
subsets
of
our
user
base
to
ensure
they
perform
as
expected
.
For
example
we
might
deploy
a
new
network
protocol
backend
to
1
%
of
our
users
to
ensure
it
doesn
t
increase
average
connection
times
or
failure
rates
.
Building
a
full
-
stack
web
-
compatible
browser
is
extremely
complicated
and
there
is
no
realistic
way
to
do
it
without
representative
telemetry
and
experimentation
.
For
example
page
-
load
speed
depends
on
many
factors
like
network
conditions
and
hardware
quirks
which
cannot
be
exhaustively
tested
in
automation
.
Telemetry
allows
Mozilla
to
determine
how
Firefox
is
performing
for
users
and
measure
whether
big
changes
make
things
faster
or
slower
before
deploying
them
to
everyone
.
The
browsers
that
brag
about
not
having
telemetry
all
use
someone
else
s
engine
(
generally
Chromium
)
and
thus
rely
on
the
engine
vendor
to
collect
telemetry
and
tune
the
stack
correctly
.
We
strive
to
keep
Firefox
independent
and
competitive
so
we
need
infrastructure
to
tell
us
what
is
and
is
not
working
well
.
Ordinary
telemetry
is
associated
with
a
pseudonymous
identifier
called
a
client
ID
.
Our
data
infrastructure
endeavors
to
make
it
difficult
to
associate
a
client
ID
with
identifiable
data
but
this
is
not
a
strong
guarantee
.
Therefore
ordinary
telemetry
is
generally
restricted
to
low
-
sensitivity
technical
and
interaction
data
.
Note
that
interaction
here
refers
to
interaction
with
_Firefox
UI_
not
web
content
.
The
latter
would
inherently
reveal
browsing
data
and
is
thus
off
-
limits
.
#
#
Verifiable
Guarantees
As
discussed
above
sensitive
information
like
browsing
data
must
be
protected
by
a
verifiable
guarantee
of
secrecy
(
modulo
the
exceptions
listed
[
below
]
(
#
exceptions
)
)
.
This
section
outlines
the
current
mechanisms
Firefox
uses
to
provide
such
a
guarantee
in
different
situations
:
1
.
*
*
On
-
Device
Processing
:
*
*
This
is
the
default
and
should
be
used
wherever
possible
.
2
.
*
*
End
-
to
-
End
Encryption
:
*
*
This
is
used
for
situations
where
Mozilla
needs
to
store
user
data
as
an
opaque
payload
.
The
bookmark
history
and
password
sync
feature
is
the
canonical
use
-
case
for
this
feature
.
To
be
clear
the
ends
of
this
type
of
End
-
to
-
End
encryption
are
a
users
devices
and
exclude
Mozilla
.

.
*
*
Oblivious
HTTP
:
*
*
OHTTP
is
an
[
IETF
standard
]
[
ietf
-
ohttp
]
for
concealing
the
IP
address
in
HTTPS
transactions
which
can
be
used
to
create
a
verifiable
guarantee
that
a
network
service
cannot
link
a
request
to
a
client
.
It
does
this
by
routing
the
request
through
an
independently
-
operated
relay
(
in
our
case
[
Fastly
]
[
dap
-
ohttp
-
partners
]
)
.
The
protocol
ensures
that
the
relay
provider
sees
the
source
of
the
request
but
not
the
contents
and
the
endpoint
sees
the
contents
but
not
the
source
(
more
explanation
[
here
]
[
sumo
-
ohttp
]
)
.
For
this
to
work
the
payload
must
be
carefully
vetted
to
ensure
that
its
contents
are
non
-
identifying
.
There
are
obvious
ways
to
get
this
wrong
(
e
.
g
.
including
any
sort
of
personal
identifier
)
but
subtler
ones
as
well
(
e
.
g
.
a
set
of
innocuous
values
that
could
be
jointly
unique
to
a
user
)
.
For
this
reason
any
usage
of
OHTTP
requires
careful
analysis
from
a
privacy
expert
as
part
of
data
review
.

[
DAP

[

is
a
standards

Multi
-
Party
Computation
(

aggregate
measurement
protocol
with
formally
verifiable

guarantees
.
It
allows
computing
aggregate

a
population
(

how
many

)
without
the
individual
data

being

to
any
party
off
the
device
.
There
are
a
lot
of
[
complicated
details
]
[
dap
-

]
but
an
important
upshot
is
that
the
protocol
incorporates
differential
privacy
guards
to
make
it
virtually
impossible
to
inadvertently
leak
individual
information
with
too
small
of
a
sample
(
it
does
this
by
automatically
adding
noise
whose
magnitude
is
inversely
proportional
to
the

size
)

Exceptions
There
are
a
few
exceptional
cases
where
information
related
to
a
website
visited
by
the
user
is
sent
to
Mozilla
without
a
verifiable
guarantee
.
These
are
generally
unsurprising
and
self
-
explanatory
but
it
s
worth
writing
them
down
.
If
you
discover
one
that
isn
t
listed
here
please
flag
it
to
the
[

so
that
it
can
be
either
addressed
or

(
which
depending

Visiting

*
Mozilla
like
any
website
operator
has
the
technical
capability
to
observe
which
websites
are
loaded
by
a
given
IP
address
.
Some
sites
like
[

.
mozilla

]
(

)
also
have
special

functionality
.

The
New

:
*
*
Firefox
provides
an
optional
feed
of
news
articles
and
other
content
on
the
Home
and
New
Tab
pages
.
This
was
originally
designed
to
operate
somewhat
like
a
website
so
the
server
is
notified
when
a
story
is
clicked
.
We
are
investigating
routing
these
notifications
through
OHTTP
in
order
to
remove
this
exception
.
#
#
Data
Review
Any
data
collection
introduced
to
Firefox
requires
careful
review
.
Our
code
review
system
automatically
detects
the
most
common
patterns
(
e
.
g
.
new
or
modified
[
glean
probes
]
[
gleandict
]
)
and
flags
any
matching
changesets
for
classification
.
However
these
heuristics
may
not
catch
unusual
patterns
and
so
code
reviewers
are
responsible
for
manually
flagging
anything
that
slips
through
the
cracks
.
The
details
of
the
data
review
process
for
Firefox
patches
are
documented
[
here
]
[

]
.
[
^

]
:
To
Mozilla
.
To
state
the
obvious
the
architecture
of
the
web
platform
means
that
interactions
with
a
website
are
generally
observable
to
the
operator
of
that
website
.
[
^
2
]
:
This
is
referred
to
in
documentation
and
settings
as
technical
and
interaction
data
.
People
often
mistakenly
equate
this
with
data
collection
in
Firefox
but
the
latter
is
a
broader
category
.
For
example
Firefox
also
has
a
separate
[
daily
usage
ping
]
[
usage
-
ping
]
to
count
users
and
the
content
feed
on
New
Tab
maintains
its
own
separate
communication
channel
.
These
are
all
optional
but
the
features
are
controlled
separately
.
Disabling
Telemetry
does
not
disable
the
New
Tab
content
and
vice
-
versa
