You
can
use
any
editor
or
IDE
to
contribute
to
Firefox
as
long
as
it
can
edit
text
files
.
However
there
are
some
steps
specific
to
mozilla
-
central
that
may
be
useful
for
a
better
development
experience
.

When

when
you
open
the

it
will
be
automatically

Visual

Code
will
ask

When

.
code
:
:
"
editor
.
formatOnSave
"
:
true
you
might
find
that
this
isn
'
t
working
on
large
source
code
files
but
triggering
formatting
manually
works
.
This
is
due
to
the
default
timeout
for
formatOnSave
which
is
quite
short
(
750ms
)
.
You
might
want
to
increase
this
timeout
