If
you
want
to
find
a
specific
crash
that
you
submitted
you
first
need
to
find
the
Crash
ID
that
the
server
has
assigned
your
crash
.
Type
about
:
crashes
into
your
location
bar
to
get
a
page
listing
both
submitted
and
unsubmitted
crash
reports
.

in
reports
of
"

for
each

There
is
also
a
custom
query
tool
which
allows
users
to
limit

on
more
precise
information
.
Finally
a
set
of
Mozilla
employees
have
access
to
directly
query
the
underlying
data
in
either
SQL
summary
or
using
mapreduce
on
the
storage
cluster
.
