The
two
tests
follow
the
basic
same
3
steps
:
*
1
.
Firefox
loads
early_hint_asset_html
.
sjs
?
as
=
image
&
code
=
{
httpCode
}
&
hinted
=
1
&
crossOrigin
=
0
*
2
.
Server
returns
103
response
with
Link
to
early_hint_asset
.
sjs
?
as
=
image
*
3
.
The
server
then
returns
a
302
with
location
early_hint_main_html
.
sjs
.
*
The
expected
number
of
early
hints
for
"
test_eh_before_redirect
"
is
1
before
the
redirect
occurs
.
*
This
test
redirects
to
the
same
origin
and
which
is
why
the
early
hint
won
'
t
be
canceled
.
*
/
add_task
(
async
function
test_eh_before_redirect
(
)
{
await
test_hint_completion_on_redirect
(
test_eh_before_redirect
false
{
hinted
:
1
normal
:
0
}
)
;
}
)
;
/
*
*
*
This
test
follows
the
same
step
as
above
with
crossOrigin
=
1
which
redirects
the
test
to
a
different
tld
.
*
The
expected
number
of
early
hints
is
0
since
we
redirect
to
a
different
origin
.
The
number
of
normal
is
0
too
*
since
the
count
isn
'
t
increased
in
early_hint_main_html
.
sjs
