Introduction
to
Mochitest
framework
with
Http
/
2
and
Http
/
3
support
The
Mochitest
framework
currently
utilizes
[
httpd
.
js
]
(
https

/
/
searchfox
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
source
/
netwerk
/
test
/
httpserver
/
httpd
.
js
)
as
its
primary
HTTP
server
which
only
provides
support
for
HTTP
/
1
.
1
.
To
boost
our
testing
capacity
for
Http
/
2
and
Http
/
3
within
necko
we
improved
the
Mochitest
framework
to
enable
Firefox
to
connect
to
the
test
server
using
Http
/
2
or
Http
/
3
while
running
Mochitest
files
.

To
ensure
that
Firefox
can
access
multiple
origins
using
a
single
HTTP
server
the
Mochitest
framework
employs
proxy
autoconfig
(
PAC
)
.
This
[

(

that
all

are
proxied

When
it
comes
to
HTTPS
connections
the
Mochitest
framework
incorporates
an
additional
SSL
proxy
between
the
HTTP
server
and
the
browser
.
Initially
Firefox
sends
a
CONNECT
request
to
the
proxy
to
establish
the
tunnel
.
Upon
successful
setup
the
proxy
proceeds
to
relay
data
to
the
server
.

Reverse
Proxy
Our
reverse
proxy
positioned
in
front
of
the
back
-
end
server
intercepts
Firefox
requests
.
Acting
as
the
gateway
for
Firefox
'
s
Http
/
2
or
Http
/
3
connections
the
reverse
proxy
accepts
these
requests
and
translates
them
into
Http
/
1
.
1
format
before
forwarding
to
the
back
-
end
server
.
Upon
receiving
a
response
from
the
back
-
end
server
the
reverse
proxy
subsequently
relays
this
response
back
to
Firefox
.
#
#
#
DoH
Server
In
order
to
route
HTTP
requests
to
the
reverse
proxy
server
we
ll
need
a
DoH
server
to
be
configured
.
The
DoH
server
should
return
127
.
0
.
0
.
1
for
every
A
/
AAAA
DNS
lookup
.
Moreover
the
DoH
server
will
also
return
an
HTTPS
RR
for
two
reasons
below
:
With
the
port
information
provided
in
the
HTTPS
RR
we
can
map
all
different
port
numbers
in
server
-
locations
.
txt
to
the
port
number
that
is
used
by
the
reverse
proxy
.
With
the
alpn
defined
in
the
HTTPS
RR
Firefox
will
automatically
perform
HTTPS
upgrade
and
establish
HTTP
/
2
or
HTTP
/
3
connection
to
the
reverse
proxy
server
.

How
to
run
test
with
Http
/
2
or
Http
/
3
locally
To
execute
tests
with
Http
/
2
include
the
-
-
use
-
http2
-
server
option
.
Here
'
s
an
example
:
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
use
-
http2
-
server
PATH_TO_TEST_FILE
For
Http
/
3
testing
switch
the
option
to
-
-
use
-
http3
-
server
.
Like
this
:
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
use
-
http3
-
server
PATH_TO_TEST_FILE
