#
Terminology
and
Concepts
To
clearly
describe
the
design
we
define
two
key
terms
that
appear
frequently
throughout
this
document
:
#
#
#
Outer
Connection
The
outer
connection
refers
to
the
HTTP
/
3
connection
between
Firefox
and
the
proxy
.
This
connection
is
established
once
and
can
be
reused
for
multiple
HTTP
/
3
requests
.
#
#
#
Inner
Connection
The
inner
connection
refers
to
the
logical
UDP
tunnel
established
over
an
HTTP
/
3
stream
via
the
CONNECT
method
.
#
#
#
Connection
Establishment
Note
:
Firefox
only
supports
CONNECT
-
UDP
over
HTTP
/
3
.
Support
over
HTTP
/
2
or
HTTP
/
1
.
1
is
not
implemented
.
To
establish
a
UDP
tunnel
over
HTTP
/
3
Firefox
initiates
a
request
using
the
CONNECT
method
with
the
:
protocol
set
to
connect
-
udp
.
This
request
negotiates
a
stream
that
serves
as
the
logical
tunnel
for
encapsulated
UDP
datagrams
between
the
client
and
the
proxy
.
The
tunnel
setup
process
involves
sending
a
HEADERS
frame
on
a
new
HTTP
/
3
stream
with
the
following
pseudo
-
header
and
header
fields
:

#
Http3ConnectUDPStream
Http3ConnectUDPStream
is
the
core
implementation
of
the
CONNECT
-
UDP
in
Firefox
.
It
behaves
like
a
regular
nsIUDPSocket
allowing
the
inner
HTTP
/
3
connection
to
send
and
receive
UDP
datagrams
.
Internally
it
encapsulates
outgoing
UDP
datagrams
into
HTTP
datagrams
which
are
then
sent
over
the
outer
HTTP
/
3
connection
to
the
proxy
.
Incoming
HTTP
datagrams
from
the
proxy
are
decoded
and
delivered
as
UDP
packets
to
the
consumer
.
