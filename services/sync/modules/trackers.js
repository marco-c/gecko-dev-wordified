Tracker
objects
for

engine
may
need
to
subclass
the
*
getScore
routine
which
returns
the
current
'
score
'
for
that
*
engine
.
How
the
engine
decides
to
set
the
score
is
upto
it

as
long
as
the
value
between
0
and
100
actually
corresponds

to
its
urgency
to
sync

*
Here
'
s
an
example
BookmarksTracker

We
don
'
t
subclass
getScore
*
because
the
observer
methods
take
care
of
updating
_score
which
*
getScore
returns
by
default
.
