There
are
two
ways
we
could
calculate
the
score
.
We
could
calculate
it
*
incrementally
by
using
the
window
mediator
to
watch
for
windows
opening
/
*
closing
and
FUEL
(
or
some
other
API
)
to
watch
for
tabs
opening
/
closing
*
and
changing
location
.
*
*
Or
we
could
calculate
it
on
demand
by
comparing
the
state
of
tabs
*
according
to
the
session
store
with
the
state
according
to
the
snapshot
.
*
*
It
'
s
hard
to
say
which
is
better
.
The
incremental
approach
is
less
*
accurate
if
it
simply
increments
the
score
whenever
there
'
s
a
change
*
but
it
might
be
more
performant
.
The
on
-
demand
approach
is
more
accurate
*
but
it
might
be
less
performant
depending
on
how
often
it
'
s
called
.
*
*
In
this
case
we
'
ve
decided
to
go
with
the
on
-
demand
approach
and
we
*
calculate
the
score
as
the
percent
difference
between
the
snapshot
set
*
and
the
current
tab
set
where
tabs
that
only
exist
in
one
set
are
*
completely
different
while
tabs
that
exist
in
both
sets
but
whose
data
*
doesn
'
t
match
(
f
.
e
.
because
of
variations
in
history
)
are
considered
*
"
half
different
"
.
*
*
So
if
the
sets
don
'
t
match
at
all
we
return
100
;
*
if
they
completely
match
we
return
0
;
*
if
half
the
tabs
match
and
their
data
is
the
same
we
return
50
;
*
and
if
half
the
tabs
match
but
their
data
is
all
different
we
return
75
.
