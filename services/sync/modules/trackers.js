Changed
IDs
are
in
an
object
(
hash
)
to
make
it
easy
to
check
if
*
one
is
already
set
or
not
.
*
Note
that
it
would
be
nice
to
make
these
methods
asynchronous
so
*
as
to
not
block
when
writing
to
disk
.
However
these
will
often
*
get
called
from
observer
callbacks
and
so
it
is
better
to
make
*
them
synchronous
.
