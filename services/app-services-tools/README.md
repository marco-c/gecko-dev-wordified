App
Services
Tooling
This
directory
holds
tools
implemented
by
application
-
services
and
required
to
be
used
in
the
build
process
.
There
are
2
such
tools
-
'
embedded
-
uniffi
-
bindgen
'
and
'
nimbus
-
fml
'
both
of
which
will
be
called
by
the
gradle
build
system
.
Note
that
these
are
effectively
wrappers
-
the
tools
themselves
remain
in
the
app
-
services
directory
but
these
crates
form
a
wrapper
around
them
meaning
consumers
don
'
t
need
to
know
the
full
path
to
the
tool
just
the
path
to
this
directory
.
NOTE
:
This
is
landing
before
app
-
services
itself
.
That
means
that
currently
these
are
just
stub
tools
.
Once
we
move
app
-
services
into
this
directory
the
stubs
will
be
updated
to
become
actual
wrappers
around
the
tools
.
This
helps
us
solve
a
bit
of
a
chicken
-
and
-
egg
problem
landing
app
-
services
.
Updating
these
stubs
is
bug
2002854
.
