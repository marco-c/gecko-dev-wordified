Pushing
to
Try
"
allows
developers
to
build
and
test
their
changes
on
Mozilla
'
s
automation
servers
without
requiring
their
code
to
be
reviewed
and
landed
.
First
:
doc
:
ensure
that
you
can
push
to
Try
<
configuration
>
.
Try
knows
how
to
run
tasks
that
are
defined
in
-
tree
such
as
build
-
linux64
/
opt
(
build
Firefox
for
Linux
)
.
To
manually
select
some
tasks
for
Try
to
process
run
the
following
command
:
.
.
code
-
block
:
:
shell
.
/
mach
try
fuzzy
After
submitting
your
requested
tasks
you
'
ll
be
given
a
link
to
your
"
push
"
in
Treeherder
.
It
may
take
a
few
minutes
for
your
push
to
appear
in
Treeherder
!
Be
patient
and
it
will
automatically
update
when
Try
begins
processing
your
work
.
Another
very
useful
Try
command
is
.
/
mach
try
auto
which
will
automatically
select
the
tasks
that
are
mostly
likely
to
be
affected
by
your
changes
.
See
the
:
doc

page
<

to
view
all
the
other
ways
to
select
which
tasks
to
push

Try
builds
aren
'
t
signed
the
same
way
as
release
builds
so
on
modern
platforms
you
may
run
into
errors
when
you
try
run
them
.
For
example
on
macOS
you
'
ll
see
an
error
like
"
<
app
>
is
damaged
and
can
'
t
be
opened
.
"
This
is
because
when
the
app
is
downloaded
your
browser
adds
an
attribute
noting
that
it
originated
from
the
internet
and
isn
'
t
as
trustworthy
.
You
can
resolve
this
by
clearing
the
attribute
after
downloading
(
xattr
-
c
<
app
>
on
Mac
)
or
by
downloading
the
app
using
curl
<
https
:
/
/
curl
.
se
/
>
_
instead
