Mercurial
is
a
source
-
code
management
tool
which
allows
users
to
keep
track
of
changes
to
the
source
code
locally
and
share
their
changes
with
others
.
We
use
it
for
the
development
of
Firefox
.

Basic
configuration

You
should
configure
Mercurial
before
submitting
patches
to
Mozilla
.
If
you
will
be
pulling
the
Firefox
source
code
or
one
of
the
derived
repositories
the
easiest
way
to
configure
Mercurial
is
to
run
the
vcs
-
setup
mach
command
:
.
.
code
-
block
:
:
shell
.
/
mach
vcs
-
setup
This
command
starts
an
interactive
wizard
that
will
help
ensure
your
Mercurial
is
configured
with
the
latest
recommended
settings
.
This
command
will
not
change
any
files
on
your
machine
without
your
consent
.

If
you
have
access
to
the
try
server
you
may
want
to
configure
Mercurial
so
you
can
refer
to
it
simply
as
"
try
"
since
it
can
be
useful
from
all
your
trees
.
This
can
be
done
by
adding
this
to
your
~
/
.
hgrc
file
:
.
.
code
-
block
:
:
shell
[

try
