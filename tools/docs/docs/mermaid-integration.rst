Mermaid
is
a
tool
that
lets
you
generate
flow
charts
sequence
diagrams
gantt
charts
class
diagrams
and
vcs
graphs
from
a
simple
markup
language
.
This
means
you
can
embed
these
directly
in
the
source
rather
than
creating
an
image
with
some
external
tool
and
then
checking
it
into
the
tree
.
To
add
a
diagram
simply
put
something
like
this
into
your
page
:

.
