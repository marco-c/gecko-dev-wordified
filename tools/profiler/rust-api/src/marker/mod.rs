This
marker
API
has
a
few
different
functions
that
you
can
use
to
mark
a
part
of
your
code
.
/
/
!
There
are
three
main
marker
functions
to
use
from
Rust
:
[
add_untyped_marker
]
/
/
!
[
add_text_marker
]
and
[
add_marker
]
.
They
are
similar
to
what
we
have
on
/
/
!
the
C
+
+
side
.
Please
take
a
look
at
the
marker
documentation
in
the
Firefox
/
/
!
source
docs
to
learn
more
about
them
