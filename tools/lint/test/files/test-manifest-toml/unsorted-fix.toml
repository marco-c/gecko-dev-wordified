Bug
1867328
#
Enabling
the
JS
feature
leaks
an
8
-
byte
object
.
This
causes
failures
when
#
the
leak
checker
is
enabled
and
run
with
test
-
verify
(
i
.
e
.
with
both
#
"
debug
"
and
"
verify
"
)
.
Having
JS
support
for
this
feature
is
more
important
#
than
these
tests
so
we
'
re
disabling
them
for
now
.
