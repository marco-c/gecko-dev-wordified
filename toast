Hey
Chris
I
apologize
to
ask
this
of
you
but
I
was
wondering
if
you
might
be
able
to
find
time
to
prioritize
these
data
reviews
today

I
'
ve
been
working
hard
to
try
to
get
some
of
the
most
critical
metrics
implemented
for
our
first
round
of
QA
testing
while
Translations
is
enabled
in
Nightly
and
Early
Beta
.
I
apologize
about
the
rushed
nature
of
this
.
I
'
ve
never
done
telemetry
before
and
there
was
a
lot
of
knowledge
to
take
in
in
a
short
time
.
My
plan
is
to
revisit
these
metrics
and
add
more
over
the
next
month
before
our
second
round
of
beta
testing
.
If
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
set
an
expiration
for
these
rather
than
never
I
think
that
'
s
reasonable
.
The
ultimate
intent
is
to
have
them
never
expire
but
I
realize
these
exact
metrics
may
not
be
perfect
or
idiomatic
.
I
'
m
also
happy
to
make
any
changes
today
if
you
find
something
undesirable
about
them
but
I
'
m
really
hoping
to
land
these
during
this
soft
freeze
given
that
it
doesn
'
t
change
any
implementation
details
(
only
adds
telemetry
)
and
we
really
want
to
have
some
measurements
in
this
first
early
-
beta
cycle
.
