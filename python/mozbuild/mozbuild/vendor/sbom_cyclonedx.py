All

determinism

injected

product_notices
are
license
notices
that

license
reproduces
    
without
naming
a
path
the
MPL
and
the
bundled
spellchecking
dictionaries
    
among
them
.
They
belong
to
the
product
as
a
whole
rather
than
to
any
one
    
component
so
they
land
on
the
root
.
    
product_name
names
the
root
component
.
The
same
shippable
builds
that
    
generate
an
SBOM
include
GeckoView
so
the
caller
passes
the
configuration

letting

collects
the

an
