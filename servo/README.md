Parallel
Browser
Project
Servo
is
a
prototype

written
in

]

It
is
currently
developed
on
OS
X
and

Servo
builds
its
own
copy
of
Rust
so
there
is
no
need
to
provide
a
Rust
compiler
.

Build
Workarounds
#
#
#
MacPorts
Currently
the
Makefile
for
the
rust
-
azure
submodule
has
hardcoded
library
paths
that
assumes
cairo
has
been
installed
with
homebrew
or
MacPorts
.
If
you
have
installed
cairo
via
another
methods
or
a
different
version
you
will
need
to
change
the
library
path
.
This
problem
should
go
away
once
Issue
#
40
is
fixed
and
an
externally
-
built
cairo
is
no
longer
needed
.
