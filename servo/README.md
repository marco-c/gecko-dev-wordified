The
Servo
Parallel
Browser
Project
Servo
is
a
web
browser
engine
written
in
the
Rust
language
.
It
is
currently
developed
on
OS
X
and
Linux
.
Note
:
Servo
requires
a
bleeding
-
edge
version
of
Rust
.
The
Rust
commit
most
recently
tested
is
listed
below
.
Servo
often
doesn
'
t
build
against
Rust
_incoming_
or
_master_
branches
due
to
upstream
language
changes
.
If
you
want
to
unbreak
Servo
against
the
latest
Rust
build
somebody
in
#
servo
or
#
rust
will
usually
know
what
magic
is
required
to
fix
the
build
.

Workarounds
#
#
#
#
MacPorts
Currently
the
Makefile
for
the
rust
-
azure
submodule
has
hardcoded
library
paths
that
assumes
cairo
has
been
installed
with
homebrew
or
MacPorts
.
If
you
have
installed
cairo
via
another
methods
or
a
different
version
you
will
need
to
change
the
library
path
.
This
problem
should
go
away
once
Issue
#
40
is
fixed
and
an
externally
-
built
cairo
is
no
longer
needed
.
