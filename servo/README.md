The
Servo
Parallel
Browser
Project
Servo
is
a
web
browser
engine
written
in
the
Rust
language
.
It
is
currently
developed
on
OS
X
and
Linux
.
Note
:
Servo
requires
a
bleeding
-
edge
version
of
Rust
.
Sometimes
this
means
working
off
of
the
Rust
_master_
branch
;
sometimes
this
means
the
_incoming_
branch
.
Because
Rust
is
still
undergoing
major
changes
the
Servo
build
is
very
often
broken
.
Somebody
in
#
servo
or
#
rust
will
usually
know
what
magic
is
required
to
make
Servo
build
on
any
given
day
.
Good
luck
!
