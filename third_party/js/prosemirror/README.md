Development
notes
-
If
you
need
a
bundle
that
is
not
minified
for
stack
traces
during
development
you
can
generate
one
with
npm
run
build
:
dev
.
-
Individual
package

and
sources
live
under
third_party
/
js
/
prosemirror
/
prosemirror
-
*
with
separate
moz
.
yaml
files
.
The
bundle
consumes
these
via
file
:
dependencies
in
package
.
json
.
