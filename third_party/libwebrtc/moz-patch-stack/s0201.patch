fix
windows
build
failure
caused
by
a
macro
expansion
Commit
38c5a66082
adds
the
include
rtc_base
/
strings
/
string_builder
.
h
to
third_party
/
libwebrtc
/
modules
/
desktop_capture
/
desktop_geometry
.
h
but
we
pick
this
up
through
a
chain
of
includes
in
CamerasParent
.
cpp
.
On
Windows
builds
we
then
get
a
failure
because
Shlwapi
.
h
has
a
macro
that
expands
StrCat
to
StrCatW
which
means
we
'
re
changing
absl
:
:
StrCat
to
absl
:
:
StrCatW
which
doesn
'
t
exist
.
We
can
avoid
the
desktop_geometry
.
h
include
and
forward
declare
"
class
DesktopVector
"
to
work
around
this
issue
.
