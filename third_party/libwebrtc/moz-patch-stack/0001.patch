Fix
bug
of
messages
being
delivered
before
data
channel
is
open
If
the
caller
calls
RegisterObserver
(
)
on
the
network
thread
while
the
state
is
not
kOpen
but
there
are
queued
received
data
those
received
data
will
be
immediately
delivered
to
the
observer
before
the
state
is
transitioned
to
kOpen
which
may
break
the
observer
'
s
assertions
and
cause
problems
.
The
problem
turns
out
to
be
that
when
SctpDataChannel
:
:
RegisterObserver
calls
DeliverQueuedReceivedData
(
)
the
data
will
be
passed
to
the
observer
without
checking
the
|
state_
|
first
meanwhile
SctpDataChannel
:
:
UpdateState
does
effectively
check
the
state
and
null
-
check
|
observer_
|
before
delivering
the
received
data
.
This
CL
fixes
this
by
simply
making
DeliverQueuedReceivedData
(
)
also
check
state_
=
=
kOpen
.
In
case
the
state
transitions
to
kOpen
after
RegisterObserver
(
)
is
called
the
first
DeliverQueuedReceivedData
(
)
call
will
be
no
-
op
while
the
second
DeliverQueuedReceivedData
(
)
call
will
do
the
work
.
