The
WebRTC
API
The
public
API
of
the
WebRTC
library
consists
of
the
api
/
directory
and
its
subdirectories
.
No
other
files
should
be
depended
on
by
webrtc
users
.
Before
starting
to
code
against
the
API
it
is
important
to
understand
some
basic
concepts
such
as
:
*
Memory
management
including
webrtc
'
s
reference
counted
objects
*
[
Thread
management
]
