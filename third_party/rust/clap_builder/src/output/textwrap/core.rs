Note
:
*
*
When
the
unicode
Cargo
feature
is
disabled
all
characters
are
presumed
to
take
up
/
/
/
1
width
.
With
the
feature
enabled
function
will
correctly
deal
with
[
combining

]
in
/
/
/
their
decomposed
form
(
see
[
Unicode
equivalence
]
)
.
/
/
/
/
/
/
An
example
of
a
decomposed
character
is
which
can
be
decomposed
into
:
e
followed
by
a
/
/
/
combining
acute
accent
:
.
Without
the
unicode
Cargo
feature
every
char
has
a
width
of
/
/
/
1
.
This
includes
the
combining
accent

Characters
such
as
emojis
and
[
CJK
characters
]
used
in
the
/
/
/
Chinese
Japanese
and
Korean
languages
are
seen
as
double
-
width
/
/
/
even
if
the
unicode
-
width
feature
is
disabled
:

#
Limitations
/
/
/
/
/
/
The
displayed
width
of
a
string
cannot
always
be
computed
from
the
/
/
/
string
alone
.
This
is
because
the
width
depends
on
the
rendering
/
/
/
engine
used
.
This
is
particularly
visible
with
[
emoji
modifier
/
/
/
sequences
]
where
a
base
emoji
is
modified
with
e
.
g
.
skin
tone
or
/
/
/
hair
color
modifiers
.
It
is
up
to
the
rendering
engine
to
detect
/
/
/
this
and
to
produce
a
suitable
emoji
.
/
/
/
/
/
/
A
simple
example
is
which
consists
of
(
U
+
2764
:
Black
/
/
/
Heart
Symbol
)
followed
by
U
+
FE0F
(
Variation
Selector
-
16
)
.
By
/
/
/
itself
is
a
black
heart
but
if
you
follow
it
with
the
/
/
/
variant
selector
you
may
get
a
wider
red
heart
.
/
/
/
/
/
/
A
more
complex
example
would
be
which
should
depict
a
man
/
/
/
with
red
hair
.
Here
the
computed
width
is
too
large
and
the
/
/
/
width
differs
depending
on
the
use
of
the
unicode
-
width
feature
:
/
/
/
/
/
/
This
happens
because
the
grapheme
consists
of
three
code
points
:
/
/
/
(
U
+
1F468
:
Man
)
Zero
Width
Joiner
(
U
+
200D
)
and
/
/
/
(
U
+
1F9B0
:
Red
Hair
)
.
You
can
see
them
above
in
the
test
.
With
/
/
/
unicode
-
width
enabled
the
ZWJ
is
correctly
seen
as
having
zero
/
/
/
width
without
it
is
counted
as
a
double
-
width
character
.

Terminal
Support

/
/
/
/

Modern
browsers
typically
do
a
great
job
at
combining
characters
/
/
/
as
shown
above
but
terminals
often
struggle
more
.
As
an
example
/
/
/
Gnome
Terminal
version
3
.
38
.

shows
as
a
big
red
heart
but
