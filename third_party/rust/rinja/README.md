How
to
get
started
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
First
add
the
rinja
dependency
to
your
crate
'
s
Cargo
.
toml
:
sh
cargo
add
rinja
Now
create
a
directory
called
templates
in
your
crate
root
.
In
it
create
a
file
called
hello
.
html
containing
the
following
:
jinja
Hello
{
{
name
}
}
!
In
any
Rust
file
inside
your
crate
add
the
following
:
rust
use
rinja
:
:
Template
;
/
/
bring
trait
in
scope
#
[
derive
(
Template
)
]
/
/
this
will
generate
the
code
.
.
.
#
[
template
(
path
=
"
hello
.
html
"
)
]
/
/
using
the
template
in
this
path
relative
/
/
to
the
templates
dir
in
the
crate
root
struct
HelloTemplate
<
'
a
>
{
/
/
the
name
of
the
struct
can
be
anything
name
:
&
'
a
str
/
/
the
field
name
should
match
the
variable
name
/
/
in
your
template
}
fn
main
(
)
{
let
hello
=
HelloTemplate
{
name
:
"
world
"
}
;
/
/
instantiate
your
struct
println
!
(
"
{
}
"
hello
.
render
(
)
.
unwrap
(
)
)
;
/
/
then
render
it
.
}
You
should
now
be
able
to
compile
and
run
this
code
.
