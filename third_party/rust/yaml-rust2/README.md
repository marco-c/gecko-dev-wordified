Quick
Start
To
add
yaml
-
rust2
to
your
project
run
the
following
in
the
root
of
your
project
:
sh
cargo
add
yaml
-
rust2
Use
yaml_rust2
:
:
YamlLoader
to
load
YAML
documents
and
access
them
as
Yaml
objects
:
rust
use
yaml_rust2
:
:
{
YamlLoader
YamlEmitter
}
;
fn
main
(
)
{
let
s
=
"

=
YamlLoader
:
:
load_from_str
(

Dump

object
let

:

/
/
dump
the
YAML
object
to
a
String
}
println

Note
that
yaml_rust2
:
:
Yaml
implements
Index
<
&
'
a
str

and
Index
<

:
*
Index

otherwise
Yaml

is
returned
If
your
document
does
not
conform
to
this
convention
(
e
.
g
.
map
with
complex
type
key
)
you
can
use
the
Yaml

API
of

to
access
your

#
#
Security
This
library
does
not
try
to
interpret
any
type
specifiers
in
a
YAML
document
so
there
is
no
risk
of
say
instantiating
a
socket
with
fields
and
communicating
with
the
outside
world
just
by
parsing
a
YAML
document
.
#
#
Specification
Compliance
This
implementation
is
fully
compatible
with
the
YAML
1
.
2
specification
.
In
order
to
help
with
compliance
yaml
-
rust2
tests
against
(

passes
)

[
YAML

suite
