Yaml
now
implements
IndexMut
<
usize
>
and
IndexMut
<
&
'
a
str
>
.
These
functions
may
not
return
a
mutable
reference
to
a
BAD_VALUE
.
Instead
index_mut
(
)
will
panic
if
either
:
*
The
index
is
out
of
range
as
per
IndexMut
'
s
requirements
*
The
inner
Yaml
variant
doesn
'
t
match
Yaml
:
:
Array
for
usize
or
Yaml
:
:
Hash
for
&
'
a
str
-
Use
cargo
features
This
allows
for
more
fine
-
grained
control
over
MSRV
and
to
completely
remove
debug
code
from
the
library
when
it
is
consumed
.
The
encoding
feature
governing
the
YamlDecoder
has
been
enabled
by
default
.
Users
of
davvid
'
s
fork
of
yaml
-
rust
or
of
yaml
-
rust2
might
already
use
this
.
Users
of
the
original
yaml

crate
may
freely
disable
this
feature
(
cargo

and

-
Duplicate
keys
no
longer
allowed
Instead
of
silently
choosing
one
of
two
values
sharing
the
same
key
in
a
mapping
we
now
issue
an
error
.
This
behavior
is
part
of
the
YAML
specification
but
not
tested
by
the
yaml
-
test
-
suite
(
the
parser
needs
to
emit
events
for
both
key
-
values
)
.
Additionally
there
is
no
standard
way
of
defining
which
value
should
be
chosen
in
case
of
a
duplicate
.

Breaking
Changes
*
*
:
-
The
encoding
library
has
been
replaced
with
encoding_rs
.
If
you
use
the
trap
of
YamlDecoder
this
change
will
make
your
code
not
compile
.
An
additional
enum
YamlDecoderTrap
has
been
added
to
abstract
the
underlying
library
and
avoid
breaking
changes
in
the
future
.
This
additionally
lifts
the
encoding
dependency
on
_your_
project
if
you
were
using
that
feature
.
-
The
signature
of
the
function
for
YamlDecoderTrap

has
changed
:
-
The
