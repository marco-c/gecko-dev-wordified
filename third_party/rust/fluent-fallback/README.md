The
fluent
-
rs
workspace
is
a
collection
of
Rust
crates
implementing
[
Project
Fluent
]
[
]
a
localization
system
designed
to
unleash
the
entire
expressive
power
of
natural
language
translations
.
This
crate
is
a
high
-
level
implementation
of
a
collection
of
locale
bundles
including
fallback
between
locales
.

Usage
-
-
-
-
-
The
Localization
struct
encapsulates
a
persistent
localization
context
providing
language
fallbacking
.
The
instance
remains
available
throughout
the
whole
life
cycle
of
the
corresponding
UI
reacting
to
events
such
as
locale
changes
resource
updates
etc
.
The
API
can
be
used
directly
or
can
serve
as
an
example
of
state
manager
for
fluent
-
bundle
and
fluent
-
resmgr
.
rust
use
fluent_fallback
:
:
Localization
;
fn
main
(
)
{
/
/
generate_messages
is
a
closure
that
returns
an
iterator
over
FluentBundle
/
/
instances
.
let
loc
=
Localization
:
:
new
(
vec
!
[
"
simple
.
ftl
"
.
into
(
)
]
generate_messages
)
;
let
value
=
bundle
.
format_value
(
"
hello
-
world
"
None
)
;
assert_eq
!
(
&
value
"
Hello
world
!

)
;
