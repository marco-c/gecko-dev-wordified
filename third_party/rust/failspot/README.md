A
testing
library
that
makes
it
easy
(
ish
)
to
add
intentional
errors
to
a
program
When
testing
error
-
handling
codepaths
it
is
often
useful
to
programmatically
tell
parts
of
the
code
to
fail
.
This
crate
provides
the
failspot
!
(
)
macro
which
can
be
used
to
mark
a
spot
in
the
codepath
where
an
intentional
failure
can
be
toggled
on
and
off
from
testing
code
.
