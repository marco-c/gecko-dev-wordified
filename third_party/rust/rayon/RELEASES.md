Breaking
change
:
*
*
The
reduce
method
has
been
vastly
simplified
and
reduce_with_identity
has
been
deprecated
.
-
*
*
Breaking
change
:
*
*
The
fold
method
has
been
changed
.
It
used
to
always
reduce
the
values
but
now
instead
it
is
a
combinator
that
returns
a
parallel
iterator
which
can
itself
be
reduced
.
See
the
docs
for
more
information
.
-
The
following
parallel
iterator
combinators
are
now
available
(
thanks
cuviper
!
)
:
-
find_any
(
)
:
similar
to
find
on
a
sequential
iterator
but
doesn
'
t
necessarily
return
the
*
first
*
matching
item
-
position_any
(
)
:
similar
to
position
on
a
sequential
iterator
but
doesn
'
t
necessarily
return
the
index
of
*
first
*
matching
item
-
any
(
)
all
(
)
:
just
like
their
sequential
counterparts
-
The
count
(
)
combinator
is
now
available
for
parallel
iterators
.
-
We
now
build
with
older
versions
of
rustc
again
(
thanks
durango
!
)
as
we
removed
a
stray
semicolon
from
thread_local
!

Parallel
iterators
now
offer
an
adaptive
weight
scheme
which
means
that
explicit
weights
should
no
longer
be
necessary
in
most
cases
!
Thanks
cuviper
!
-
We
are
considering
removing
weights
or
changing
the
weight
mechanism
before

.
Examples
of
scenarios
where
you
still
need
weights
even
with
this
adaptive
mechanism
would
be
great
.
