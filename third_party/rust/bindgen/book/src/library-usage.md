Library
Usage
with
build
.
rs
This
is
the
recommended
way
to
use
bindgen
.
Often
times
C
and
C
+
+
headers
will
have
platform
-
and
architecture
-
specific
#
ifdef
s
that
affect
the
shape
of
the
Rust
FFI
bindings
we
need
to
create
to
interface
Rust
code
with
the
outside
world
.
By
using
bindgen
as
a
library
inside
your
build
.
rs
you
can
generate
bindings
for
the
current
target
on
-
the
-
fly
.
Otherwise
you
would
need
to
generate
and
maintain
x86_64
-
unknown
-
linux
-
gnu
-
bindings
.
rs
x86_64
-
apple
-
darwin
-
bindings
.
rs
etc
.
.
.
separate
bindings
files
for
each
of
your
supported
targets
which
can
be
a
huge
pain
.
The
downside
is
that
everyone
building
your
crate
also
needs
libclang
available
to
run
bindgen
.
