and
the
last

feature

:
Serde
-
powered
de
/
serialization
.
Deserialization
is
not
possible
without
access
to
an
allocator
so
it
is
behind
a
feature
gate
serdes
which
depends
on
the
alloc
feature
.
BitSlice
BitBox
and
BitVec
all
support
serialization
and
BitBox
and
BitVec
support
deserialization
#
#
#
Added
-
serdes
feature
to
serialize
BitSlice
BitBox
and
BitVec
and
deserialize
BitBox
and
BitVec
.
-
change_cursor
<
D
>
method
on
BitSlice
BitBox
and
BitVec
which
enable
changing
the
element
traversal
order
on
a
data
set
without
modifying
that
data
.
This
is
useful
for
working
with
slices
that
have
their
cursor
type
erased
such
as
crossing
serialization
or
foreign
-
language
boundaries
.
-
Internal
domain
models
for
the
memory
regions
governed
by
BitPtr
.
These
models
provide
improved
logical
support
for
manipulating
bit
sequences
with
as
little
inefficiency
as
possible
.
-
BitPtr
:
:
bare_parts
and
BitPtr
:
:
region_data
internal
APIs
for
accessing
components
of
the
pointer
structure
.
-
Clippy

now
part
of
the
development
routine

Bugfix

]

)
.
BitSlice
:
:
count_ones
and
BitSlice
:
:
count_zeros
counted
the
total
number
of
bits
present
in
a
slice
not
the
number
of
bits
set
or
unset
when
operating
inside
a
single
element
.
The
small
case
used
.
map
(
)
.
count
(
)
but
the
large
case
correctly
used
.
map
(
)
.
filter
(
)
.
count
(
)
.
The
missing
.
filter
(
)
call
to
remove
unset
or
set
bits
from
the
counting
was
the
cause
of
the
bug
.

This
version
was
a
complete
rewrite
of
the
entire
crate
.
The
minimum
compiler
version
has
been
upgraded
to
1
.
31
.
0
.
The
crate
is
written
against
the
Rust
2018
edition
of
the
language
.
It
will
be
a
1
.
0
release
after
polishing
.
#
#
#
Added
-
BitPtr
custom
pointer
representation
.
This
is
the
most
important
component
of
the
rewrite
and
what
enabled
the
expanded
feature
set
and
API
surface
.
This
structure
allows
BitSlice
and
BitVec
to
have
head
cursors
at
any
bit
not
just
at
the
front
edge
of
an
element
.
This
allows
the
crate
to
support
arbitrary
range
slicing
and
slice
splitting
and
in
turn
greatly
expand
the
usability
of
the
slice
and
vector
types
.
The
BitPtr
type
is
wholly
crate
-
internal
and
renders
the
&
BitSlice
and
BitVec
handle
types
*
*
*
wholly
incompatible
*
*
*
with
standard
Rust
slice
and
vector
handles
.
With
great
power
comes
great
responsibility
to
never
ever
interchange
these
types
through
any
means
except
the
provided
translation
API
.
-
Range
indexing
and
more
powerful
iteration
.
Bit
-
precision
addressing
allows
arbitrary
subslices
and
enables
more
of
the
slice
API
from
core
.
#
#
#
Changed
-
Almost
everything
has
been
rewritten
.
The
git
diff
for
this
version
is
horrifying
.
-
Formatting
traits
better
leverage
the
builtin
printing
structures
available
from
core
:
:
fmt
and
are
made
available
on
no_std
.
#
#
#
Removed
-
u64
is
only
usable
as
the
storage
type
on
64
-
bit
systems
;
it
has
32
-
bit
alignment
on
32
-
bit
systems
and
as
such
is
unusable
there
.

.
Note
that
the
BitSlice
tests
and
all
the
examples
are
disabled
when
the
alloc
feature
is
not
present
.
They
will
function
normally
when
alloc
is
present
but
std
is
not
.

Added
BitSlice
:
:
for_each
provides
mutable
iteration
over
a
slice
.
It
yields
each
successive
(
index
:
usize
bit
:
bool
)
pair
to
a
closure
and
stores
the
return
value
of
that
closure
at
the
yielded
index
.
BitVec
now
implements
Eq
and
Ord
against
other
BitVec
s
.
It
is
impossible
at
this
time
to
make
BitVec
generic
over
anything
that
is
Borrow
<
BitSlice
>
which
would
allow
comparisons
over
different
ownership
types
.
The
declaration
rust
impl
<
A
B
C
D
E
>
PartialEq
<
C
>
for
BitVec
<
A
B
>
where
A

Endian
B
:

C
:
Borrow
<
BitSlice
<

>
D
:
Endian
E
:
Bits
{
fn
eq
(
&
self
rhs
:
E
)
{
}
}
is
impossible
to
write
so
BitVec
=
=
BitSlice
will
be
rejected
.
As
with
many
other
traits
on
BitVec
the
implementations
are
just
a
thin
wrapper
over
the
corresponding
BitSlice
implementations
.
#
#
#
Changed
Refine
the
API
documentation
.
Rust
guidelines
recommend
imperative
rather
than
descriptive
summaries
for
function
documentation
which
largely
meant
stripping
the
trailing
-
s
from
the
first
verb
in
each
function
document
.
I
also
moved
the
example
code
from
the
trait
-
level
documentation
to
the
function
-
level
documentation
so
that
it
would
show
up
an
type
:
:
func
in
the
rustdoc
output
rather
than
just
type
.
This
makes
it
much
clearer
what
is
being
tested
.

Added
-
The

is
the

BitVec
'
s
Vec
<

.
BitVec
now
Deref
s
to
it
and
has
offloaded
all
the
work
that
does
not
require
managing
allocated
memory
.
-
Almost
all
of
the
public
API
on
both
types
has
documentation
and
example
code
.
#
#
#
Changed
-
The
implementations
of

ard
right
-
shift
are
now
faster
.
-
BitVec
can
Borrow
and
Deref
down
to
BitSlice

offloads
as
much

as
possible
to
it
.

has
better
runtime
performance

The
increased
static

used
