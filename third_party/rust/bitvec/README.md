This
crate
provides
packed
bit
-
level
analogues
to
[
T
]
and
Vec
<
T
>
.
The
slice
type
BitSlice
and
the
vector
type
BitVec
allow
bitwise
access
to
a
region
of
memory
in
any
endian
ordering
or
underlying
primitive
type
.
This
permits
construction
of
space
-
efficient
sets
or
fine
-
grained
control
over
the
values
in
a
region
of
memory
.
BitVec
is
a
strict
expansion
of
BitSlice
to
include
allocation
management
.
Since
BitVec
is
shorter
to
type
the
rest
of
this
document
will
use
it
by
default
and
mark
out
sections
that
apply
*
only
*
to
the
vector
type
and
not
to
the
slice
type
.
Unless
marked
assume
that
the
text
applies
to
both
.
BitVec
is
generic
over
an
ordering
cursor
using
the
trait
Cursor
and
the
primitive
type
using
the
trait
Bits
.
This
means
that
BitVec
structures
can
be
built
with
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
over
how
they
manage
their
memory
and
translate
between
the
in
-
memory
representation
and
their
semantic
contents
.
BitVec
acts
as
closely
to
a
standard
Vec
as
possible
and
can
be
assumed
by
default
to
be
what
a
Vec
<
u1
>
would
be
if
such
a
type
were
possible
to
express
in
Rust
.
It
has
stack
semantics
in
that
push
and
pop
operations
take
place
only
on
one
end
of
the
BitVec
s
buffer
.
It
supports
iteration
bitwise
operations
and
rendering
for
Display
and
Debug
.
#
#
How
Is
This
Different
Than
the
bit_vec
Crate
-
It
is
more
recently
actively
maintained
(
I
may
in
the
future
as
of
this
writing
let
it
lapse
)
-
It
doesn
t
have
a
hyphen
in
the
name
so
you
don
t
have
to
deal
with
the
hyphen
/
underscore
dichotomy
.
-
My
BitVec
structure
is
exactly
the
size
of
a
Vec
;
theirs
is
larger
.
-
I
have
a
BitSlice
borrowed
view
.
-
My
types
implement
all
of
the
standard
library
s
slice
and
vector
APIs
#
#
Why
Would
You
Use
This
-
You
need
to
directly
control
a
bitstream
s
representation
in
memory
.
-
You
need
to
do
unpleasant
things
with
communications
protocols
.
-
You
need
a
list
of
bool
s
that
doesn
t
waste
7
bits
for
every
bit
used
.
-
You
need
to
do
set
arithmetic
or
numeric
arithmetic
on
those
lists
.

I
wrote
this
crate
because
I
was
unhappy
with
the
other
bit
-
vector
crates
available
.
I
specifically
need
to
manage
raw
memory
in
bit
-
level
precision
and
this
is
not
a
behavior
pattern
the
other
bit
-
vector
crates
made
easily
available
to
me
.
This
served
as
the
guiding
star
for
my
development
process
on
this
crate
and
remains
the
crate
s
primary
goal
.
To
this
end
the
default
type
parameters
for
the
BitVec
type
use
u8
as
the
storage
primitive
and
use
big
-
endian
ordering
of
bits
:
the
forwards
direction
is
from
MSb
to
LSb
and
the
backwards
direction
is
from
LSb
to
MSb
.
To
use
this
crate
you
need
to
depend
on
it
in
Cargo
.
toml
:
toml
[
dependencies
]
bitvec
=
"
0
.
10
"
and
include
it
in
your
crate
root
src
/
main
.
rs
or
src
/
lib
.
rs
:
rust
no
-
run
extern
crate
bitvec
;
use
bitvec
:
:
*
;
This
imports
the
following
symbols
:
-
bitvec
!
a
macro
similar
to
vec
!
which
allows
the
creation
of
BitVec
s
of
any
desired
endianness
storage
type
and
contents
.
The
documentation
page
has
a
detailed
explanation
of
its
syntax
.
-
BitSlice
<
C
:
Cursor
T
:
Bits
>
the
actual
bit
-
slice
reference
type
.
It
is
generic
over
a
cursor
type
(
C
)
and
storage
type
(
T
)
.
Note
that
BitSlice
is
unsized
and
can
never
be
held
directly
;
it
must
always
be
behind
a
reference
such
as
&
BitSlice
or
&
mut
BitSlice
.
Furthermore
it
is
*
impossible
*
to
put
BitSlice
into
any
kind
of
intelligent
pointer
such
as
a
Box
or
Rc
!
Any
work
that
involves
managing
the
memory
behind
a
bitwise
type
*
must
*
go
through
BitBox
or
BitVec
instead
.
This
may
change
in
the
future
as
I
learn
how
to
better
manage
this
library
but
for
now
this
limitation
stands
.
-
BitVec
<
C
:
Cursor
T
:
Bits
>
the
actual
bit
-
vector
structure
type
.
It
is
generic
over
a
cursor
type
(
C
)
and
storage
type
(
T
)
.
-
Cursor
an
open
trait
that
defines
an
ordering
schema
for
BitVec
to
use
.
Little
and
big
endian
orderings
are
provided
by
default
.
If
you
wish
to
implement
other
ordering
types
the
Cursor
trait
requires
one
function
:
-
fn
at
<
T
:
Bits
>
(
index
:
u8
)
-
>
u8
takes
a
semantic
index
and
computes
a
bit
offset
into
the
primitive
T
for
it
.
-
BigEndian
a
zero
-
sized
struct
that
implements
Cursor
by
defining
the
forward
direction
as
towards
LSb
and
the
backward
direction
as
towards
MSb
.
-
LittleEndian
a
zero
-
sized
struct
that
implements
Cursor
by
defining
the
forward
direction
as
towards
MSb
and
the
backward
direction
as
towards
LSb
.
-
Bits
a
sealed
trait
that
provides
generic
access
to
the
four
Rust
primitives
usable
as
storage
types
:
u8
u16
u32
and
u64
.
usize
and
the
signed
integers
do
*
not
*
implement
Bits
and
cannot
be
used
as
the
storage
type
.
u128
also
does
not
implement
Bits
as
I
am
not
confident
in
its
memory
representation
.
BitVec
has
the
same
API
as
Vec
and
should
be
easy
to
use
.
The
bitvec
!
macro
requires
type
information
as
its
first
two
arguments
.
Because
macros
do
not
have
access
to
the
type
checker
this
currently
only
accepts
the
literal
tokens
BigEndian
or
LittleEndian
as
the
first
argument
one
of
the
four
unsigned
integer
primitives
as
the
second
argument
and
then
as
many
values
as
you
wish
to
insert
into
the
BitVec
.
It
accepts
any
integer
value
and
maps
them
to
bits
by
comparing
against
0
.
0
becomes
0
and
any
other
integer
whether
it
is
odd
or
not
becomes
1
.
While
the
syntax
is
loose
you
should
only
use
0
and
1
to
fill
the
macro
for
readability
and
lack
of
surprise
.
#
#
#
no_std
This
crate
can
be
used
in
#
!
[
no_std
]
libraries
by
disabling
the
default
feature
set
.
In
your
Cargo
.
toml
write
:
toml
[
dependencies
]
bitvec
=
{
version
=
"
0
.
10
"
default
-
features
=
false
}
or
toml
[
dependencies
.
bitvec
]
version
=
"
0
.
10
"
default
-
features
=
false
This
turns
off
the
standard
library
imports
*
and
*
all
usage
of
dynamic
memory
allocation
.
Without
an
allocator
the
bitvec
!
macro
and
the
BitVec
type
are
both
disable
and
removed
from
the
library
leaving
only
the
BitSlice
type
.
To
use
bitvec
in
a
#
!
[
no_std
]
environment
that
*
does
*
have
an
allocator
re
-
enable
the
alloc
feature
like
so
:
toml
[
dependencies
.
bitvec
]
version
=
"
0
.
10
"
default
-
features
=
false
features
=
[
"
alloc
"
]
The
alloc
feature
restores
bitvec
!
and
BitVec
as
well
as
the
BitSlice
interoperability
with
BitVec
.
The
only
difference
between
alloc
and
std
is
the
presence
of
the
standard
library
fa
ade
and
runtime
support
.
The
std
feature
turns
on
alloc
so
using
this
crate
without
any
feature
flags
*
or
*
by
explicitly
enabling
the
std
feature
will
enable
full
functionality
.

Immutable
and
mutable
access
to
the
underlying
memory
is
provided
by
the
AsRef
and
AsMut
implementations
so
the
BitVec
can
be
readily
passed
to
transport
functions
.
BitVec
implements
Borrow
down
to
BitSlice
and
BitSlice
implements
ToOwned
up
to
BitVec
so
they
can
be
used
in
a
Cow
or
wherever
this
API
is
desired
.
Any
case
where
a
Vec
/
[
T
]
pair
cannot
be
replaced
with
a
BitVec
/
BitSlice
pair
is
a
bug
in
this
library
and
a
bug
report
is
appropriate
.
BitVec
can
relinquish
its
owned
memory
as
a
Box
<
[
T
]
>
via
the
.
into_boxed_slice
(
)
method
and
BitSlice
can
relinquish
access
to
its
memory
simply
by
going
out
of
scope
.
