error
-
graph
Allows
non
-
fatal
errors
in
a
tree
of
subfunctions
to
easily
be
collected
by
a
caller
Provides
the
error_graph
:
:
ErrorList
<
E
>
type
to
hold
a
list
of
non
-
fatal
errors
that
occurred
while
a
function
was
running
.
It
has
a
subwriter
(
)
method
that
can
be
passed
as
a
parameter
to
a
subfunction
and
allows
that
subfunction
to
record
all
the
non
-
fatal
errors
it
encounters
.
When
the
subfunction
is
done
running
its
error
list
will
be
mapped
to
the
caller
'
s
error
type
and
added
to
the
caller
'
s
ErrorList
automatically
.
Since
subfunctions
may
in
-
turn
also
use
the
subwriter
(
)
function
on
the
writter
given
to
them
by
their
caller
this
creates
a
tree
of
non
-
fatal
errors
that
occurred
during
the
execution
of
an
entire
call
graph
.

#
Motivation
In
most
call
graphs
a
function
that
encounters
an
error
will
early
-
return
and
pass
an
error
type
to
its
caller
.
The
caller
will
often
respond
by
passing
that
error
further
up
the
call
stack
up
to
its
own
caller
(
possibly
after
wrapping
it
in
its
own
error
type
)
.
That
continues
so
-
on
-
and
-
so
-
forth
until
some
caller
finally
handles
the
error
returns
from
main
or
panics
.
Ultimately
the
result
is
that
some
interested
caller
will
receive
a
linear
chain
of
errors
that
led
to
the
failure
.
But
not
all
errors
are
fatal
-
-
Sometimes
a
function
might
be
able
to
continue
working
after
it
encounters
an
error
and
still
be
able
to
at
-
least
-
partially
achieve
its
goals
.
Calling
it
again
-
or
calling
other
functions
in
the
same
API
-
is
still
permissible
and
may
also
result
in
full
or
partial
functionality
.
In
that
case
the
function
may
still
choose
to
return
Result
:
:
Ok
;
however
that
leaves
the
function
with
a
dilemma
-
-
How
can
it
report
the
non
-
fatal
errors
to
the
caller
?
1
.
*
*
Return
a
tuple
in
its
Result
:
:
Ok
type
*
*
:
that
wouldn
'
t
capture
the
non
-
fatal
errors
in
the
case
that
a
fatal
error
occurs
so
it
would
also
have
to
be
added
to
the
Result
:
:
Err
type
as
well
.
That
adds
a
bunch
of
boilerplate
as
the
function
needs
to
allocate
the
list
and
map
it
into
the
return
type
for
every
error
return
and
good
return
.
It
also
makes
the
function
signature
much
more
noisy
.
2
.
*
*
Take
a
list
as
a
mutable
reference
?
*
*
:
Better
but
now
the
caller
has
to
allocate
the
list
and
there
'
s
no
way
for
it
to
opt
out
if
it
doesn
'
t
care
about
the
non
-
fatal
errors
.
3
.
*
*
Maybe
add
an
Option
to
it
?
*
*
Okay
so
a
parameter
like
errors
:
Option
<
&
mut
Vec
<
E
>
>
?
Getting
warmer
but
now
the
child
has
to
do
a
bunch
of
if
let
Some
(
v
)
=
errors
{
v
.
push
(
error
)
;
}
all
over
the
place
.
And
what
about
the
caller
side
of
it
?
For
a
simple
caller
the
last
point
isn
'
t
too
bad
:
The
caller
just
has
to
allocate
the
list
pass
Some
(
&
mut
errors
)
to
the
child
and
check
it
upon
return
.
But
often
the
caller
itself
is
keeping
its
own
list
of
non
-
fatal
errors
and
may
also
be
a
subfunction
to
some
other
caller
and
so
-
on
-
and
-
so
-
forth
.
In
this
case
we
no
longer
have
a
simple
chain
of
errors
but
instead
we
have
a
tree
of
errors
-
-
Each
level
in
the
tree
contains
all
the
non
-
fatal
errors
that
occurred
during
execution
of
a
function
and
all
subfunctions
in
its
call
graph
.
#
Solution
The
main
behavior
we
want
is
captured
by
the
WriteErrorList
trait
in
this
crate
.
It
can
be
passed
as
a
parameter
to
any
function
that
wants
to
be
able
to
report
non
-
fatal
errors
to
its
caller
and
it
gives
the
caller
flexibility
to
decide
what
it
wants
to
do
with
that
information
.
The
main
concrete
type
in
this
crate
is
ErrorList
which
stores
a
list
of
a
single
type
of
error
.
Any
time
a
list
of
errors
needs
to
be
stored
in
memory
this
is
the
type
to
use
.
It
will
usually
be
created
by
the
top
-
level
caller
using
ErrorList
:
:
default
and
any
subfunction
will
give
an
ErrorList
of
its
own
error
type
to
the
map_fn
that
was
passed
in
by
its
caller
upon
return
.
However
ErrorList
should
rarely
be
passed
as
a
parameter
to
a
function
as
that
wouldn
'
t
provide
the
caller
with
the
flexiblity
to
decide
what
strategy
it
actually
wants
to
use
when
collecting
its
subfunction
'
s
non
-
fatal
errors
.
The
caller
may
want
to
pass
direct
reference
to
its
own
error
list
it
may
want
to
pass
a
Sublist
type
that
automatically
pushes
the
subfunction
'
s
error
list
to
its
own
error
list
after
mapping
or
it
may
want
to
pass
the
DontCare
type
if
it
doesn
'
t
want
to
know
anything
about
the
subfunction
'
s
non
-
fatal
errors
.
Instead
subfunctions
should
take
impl
WriteErrorList
<
E
>
as
a
parameter
.
This
allows
any
of
those
types
above
as
well
as
mutable
references
to
those
types
to
be
passed
in
by
the
caller
.
This
also
allows
future
caller
strategies
to
be
implemented
like
a
caller
that
only
cares
how
many
non
-
fatal
errors
occurred
but
doesn
'
t
care
about
the
details
.
#
Serde
(
This
section
only
applies
if
the
serde
feature
is
enabled
)
ErrorList
implements
the
Serialize
trait
if
the
errors
it
contains
do
and
likewise
with
the
Deserialize
trait
.
This
means
that
if
every
error
type
in
the
tree
implements
these
traits
then
the
entire
tree
can
be
sent
over
the
wire
and
recreated
elsewhere
.
Very
useful
if
the
errors
are
to
be
examined
remotely
!
