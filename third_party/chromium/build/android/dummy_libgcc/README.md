Dummy
libgcc
.
a
This
directory
contains
an
empty
libgcc
.
a
file
for
use
with
the
Rust
toolchain
when
targeting
Android
.
The
Rust
compiler
unconditionally
attempts
to
link
libgcc
when
targeting
Android
so
-
lgcc
appears
in
the
linker
command
when
producing
a
.
so
file
for
Android
.
Rustc
expects
libgcc
will
provide
unwinding
support
however
we
already
use
libunwind
which
we
explicitly
link
ourselves
through
ldflags
to
provide
this
.
Our
Android
toolchain
has
no
libgcc
present
which
means
Rustc
driven
linking
targeting
Android
fails
with
a
missing
library
that
we
don
'
t
actually
want
to
use
.
This
same
issue
occurs
for
other
consumers
of
rustc
when
building
for
targets
without
a
libgcc
and
the
solution
is
to
[
give
rustc
an
empty
libgcc
.
a
file
]

.
Therefore
this
directory
contains
an
empty
libgcc
.
a
file
and
on
Android
we
include
this
directory
in
the
linker
paths
so
that
the
rustc
-
driven
linking
step
can
succeed
without
needing
a
real
libgcc
.
