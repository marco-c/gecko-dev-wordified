#
The
traditional
Mozilla
build
system
relied
on
going
through
the
entire
#
build
tree
a
number
of
times
with
different
targets
and
many
of
the
#
things
happening
at
each
step
required
other
things
happening
in
previous
#
steps
without
any
documentation
of
those
dependencies
.
#
#
This
new
build
system
tries
to
start
afresh
by
establishing
what
files
or
#
operations
are
needed
for
the
build
and
applying
the
necessary
rules
to
#
have
those
in
place
relying
on
make
dependencies
to
get
them
going
.
#
#
As
of
writing
only
building
non
-
compiled
parts
of
Firefox
is
supported
#
here
(
a
few
other
things
are
also
left
out
)
.
This
is
a
starting
point
with
#
the
intent
to
grow
this
build
system
to
make
it
more
complete
.
#
#
This
file
contains
rules
and
dependencies
to
get
things
working
.
The
intent
#
is
for
a
Makefile
to
define
some
dependencies
and
variables
and
include
#
this
file
.
What
needs
to
be
defined
there
and
ends
up
being
generated
by
#
python
/
mozbuild
/
mozbuild
/
backend
/
fastermake
.
py
is
the
following
:
#
-
TOPSRCDIR
/
TOPOBJDIR
respectively
the
top
source
directory
and
the
top
#
object
directory
#
-
PYTHON
the
path
to
the
python
executable
#
-
ACDEFINES
which
contains
a
set
of
-
Dvar
=
name
to
be
used
during
#
preprocessing
#
-
MOZ_CHROME_FILE_FORMAT
which
defines
whether
to
use
file
copies
or
#
symbolic
links
#
-
JAR_MN_TARGETS
which
defines
the
targets
to
use
for
jar
manifest
#
processing
see
further
below
#
-
PP_TARGETS
which
defines
the
file
paths
of
preprocessed
files
see
#
further
below
#
-
INSTALL_MANIFESTS
which
defines
the
list
of
base
directories
handled
#
by
install
manifests
see
further
below
#
-
MANIFEST_TARGETS
which
defines
the
file
paths
of
chrome
manifests
see
#
further
below
#
#
A
convention
used
between
this
file
and
the
Makefile
including
it
is
that
#
global
Make
variables
names
are
uppercase
while
"
local
"
Make
variables
#
applied
to
specific
targets
are
lowercase

The

corresponds
to
the
list
of
jar
-
%
targets
#
to
be
processed
with
the
jar
-
prefix
stripped
.
#
The
Makefile
is
expected
to
specify
the
source
jar
manifest
as
a
dependency
#
to
each
target
.
There
is
no
expectation
that
the
jar
-
%
target
name
matches
#
the
source
file
name
in
any
way
.
For
example
:
#
JAR_MN_TARGETS
=
foo
#
jar
-
foo
:
/
path
/
to
/
some
/
jar
.
mn
#
Additionally
extra
defines
can
be
specified
for
the
processing
of
the
jar
#
manifest
by
settig
the
defines
variable
specifically
for
the
given
target
.
#
For
example
:
#
jar
-
foo
:
defines
=
-
Dqux
=
foo
#
The
default
base
path
where
files
are
going
to
be
installed
is
dist
/
bin
.
#
It
is
possible
to
use
a
different
path
by
setting
the
install_target
#
variable
.
For
example
:
#
jar
-
foo
:
install_target
=
dist
/
bin
/
foo
#
When
processing
jar
manifests
relative
paths
given
inside
a
jar
manifest
#
can
be
resolved
from
an
object
directory
.
The
default
path
for
that
object
#
directory
is
the
translation
of
the
jar
manifest
directory
path
from
the
#
source
directory
to
the
object
directory
.
That
is
for
#
(
TOPSRCDIR
)
/
path
/
to
/
jar
.
mn
the
default
would
be
(
TOPOBJDIR
)
/
path
/
to
.
#
In
case
a
different
path
must
be
used
for
the
object
directory
the
objdir
#
variable
can
be
set
.
For
example
:
#
jar
