Summary
Now
that
Fenix
has
been
fully
migrated
to
rely
on
Android
Component
'
s
lib
-
state
library
Fenix
'
s
architecture
can
be
further
simplified
by
refactoring
view
components
to
directly
use
our
Redux
-
like
store
instead
of
going
through
various
layers
of
Interactor
s
and
Controller
s
.
#
#
Motivation
The
Interactor
/
Controller
types
as
a
design
pattern
have
recently
had
their
usefulness
and
clarity
come
into
question
in
reviews
and
conversations
with
some
regularity
.
Interactor
s
in
particular
seem
to
often
be
an
unnecessary
abstraction
layer
usually
containing
methods
that
call
similarly
named
methods
in
a
Controller
that
share
a
similar
name
to
the
interactor
calling
them
.
Interactors
that
are
used
solely
to
delegate
to
other
classes
will
be
referred
to
as
'
passthrough
'
interactors
throughout
this
document
.
The
[
definition
]
(
.
.
/
.
.
/
fenix
/
docs
/
architecture
-
overview
.
md
#
interactor
)
of
interactors
in
our
architecture
overview
indicate
that
this
is
at
least
partially
intentional
:
'
Called
in
response
to
a
direct
user
action
.
Delegates
to
something
else
'
.
This
is
even
referenced
as
a
[
limitation
at
the
end
of
the
overview
]
(
.
.
/
.

fenix
/

/
architecture
-
overview
.

#
known
-
limitations
)
.
Historically
the
interactor
/
controller
pattern
evolved
from
a
Presenter
/
Controller
/
View
pattern
that
originated
in
Android
Components
.
The
underlying
motivation
of
that
pattern
was
to
separate
code
presenting
the
state
from
the
view
(
Presenters
)
and
the
code
that
updated
the
state
from
the
view
(
Controllers
)
.
Generally
the
interactor
/
controller
pattern
is
also
intended
to
move
business
logic
out
of
classes
tied
to
the
Android
framework
and
into
classes
that
are
more
testable
re
-
usable
composable
digestible
and
which
handle
a
single
responsibility
.

goals

goals
)
.
These
goals
are
all
met
reasonably
well
by
the
existing
pattern
but
it
also
contributes
to
unnecessary
class
explosion
general
code
complexity
and
confusion
about
responsibility
for
each
architectural
type
.
This
becomes
especially
true
when
wondering
how
responsibility
should
be
split
between
interactors
and
controllers
.
It
seems
that
interactors
are
often
included
as
a
matter
of
precedent
and
not
to
necessarily
facilitate
all
the
goals
mentioned
above
and
this
has
lead
to
a
large
amount
passthrough
interactors
.

Other

seem
to
have
mixed
responsibilities
including
but
not

to
:
-
dispatching
actions
to
Store
s

events
-

s
or
directly
to

instead
of

s
.
#
#
Guide
-
level
explanation
The
proposal
is
to
remove
interactors
and
controllers
completely
from
the
codebase
.
Their
usages
will
be
replaced
with
direct
Store
observations
and
direct
action
dispatches
to
those
Stores
.
All
state
changes
would
be
handled
by
reducers
and
side
-
effects
like
telemetry
or
disk
writes
would
be
handled
in
middlewares
.
This
would
address
all
the
goals
listed
above
:
1
.
Code
comprehensibility
should
be
improved
by
having
a
single
architectural
pattern
.
All
business
logic
would
be
discoverable
within
Reducer
s
and
changes
to
State
would
be
much
more
explicit
.
2
.
Responsibility
would
be
clearly
delineated
as
all
business
logic
would
be
handled
by
Reducer
s
and
all
side
-
effects
by
Middleware
instead
of
being
scattered
between
those
components
as
well
as
Interactor
s
Controller
s
and
various
utility
classes
.
3
.
State
management
would
happen
within
Reducer
s
and
would
still
accomplish
the
usual
goals
around
testability
.
4
.
Refactoring
interactors
/
controllers
to
instead
dispatch
actions
and
react
to
state
changes
should
be
doable
on
a
per
-
component
basis
.
Additionally
there
are
tons
of
prior
art
discussing
the
benefits
of
a
unidirectional
data
flow
including
the
[
Redux
documentation
]

#
#
Reference
-
level
explanation
Throughout
the
app
are
examples
of
chains
of
interactors
and
controllers
which
lead
to
a
method
that
dispatches
events
to
a
Store
anyway
.
Simplifying
this
mental
model
should
allow
faster
code
iteration
and
code
navigation
.
For
one
example
here
is
the
code
path
that
happens
when
a
user
long
-
clicks
a
history
item
:
kotlin
/
/
1
.
in
LibrarySiteItemView
setOnClickListener
{
val
selected
=
holder
.
selectedItems
when
{
selected
.
isEmpty
(
)
-
>
interactor
.
open
(
item
)
item
in
selected
-
>
interactor
.
deselect
(
item
)
/
/
"
select
"
is
the
path
we
are
following
else
-
>
interactor
.
select
(
item
)
}
}
/
/
2
.
Clicking
into
interactor
.
select
will
lead
to
SelectionInteractor
<
T
>
.
/
/
3
.
Searching
for
implementors
of
that
interface
will
lead
us
to
another
interface
HistoryInteractor
:
SelectionInteractor
<
History
>
/
/
4
.
DefaultHistoryInteractor
implements
HistoryInteractor
override
fun
open
(
item
:
History
)
{
historyController
.
handleSelect
(
item
)
}
/
/
5
.
Clicking
into
handleSelect
leads
to
HistoryController
/
/
6
.
DefaultHistoryController
implements
HistoryController
:
:
handleSelect
override
fun
handleSelect
(
item
:
History
)
{
if
(
store
.
state
.
mode
=
=
=
HistoryFragmentState
.
Mode
.
Syncing
)
{
return
}
store
.
dispatch
(
HistoryFragmentAction
.
AddItemForRemoval
(
item
)
)
}
/
/
7
.
reducer
handles
state
update
private
fun
historyStateReducer
(
state
:
HistoryFragmentState
action
:
HistoryFragmentAction
)
:
HistoryFragmentState
{
return
when
(
action
)
{
is
HistoryFragmentAction
.
AddItemForRemoval
-
>
state
.
copy
(
mode
=
HistoryFragmentState
.
Mode
.
Editing
(
state
.
mode
.
selectedItems
+
action
.
item
)
)
.
.
.
}
}
Following
this
proposal
the
above
would
change
to
something
like
:
kotlin
/
/
1
.
in
LibrarySiteItemView
setOnClickListener
{
when
{
selected
.
isEmpty
(
)
-
>
store
.
dispatch
(
HistoryFragmentAction
.
AddItemForRemoval
(
item
)
)
.
.
.
}
}
/
/
2
.
reducer
handles
state
private
fun
historyStateReducer
(
state
:
HistoryFragmentState
action
:
HistoryFragmentAction
)
:
HistoryFragmentState
{
return
when
(
action
)
{
is
HistoryFragmentAction
.
AddItemForRemoval
(
item
)
-
>
when
(
state
.
mode
)
{
HistoryFragmentState
.
Mode
.
Syncing
-
>
state
else
-
>
state
.
copy
(
mode
=
HistoryFragmentState
.
Mode
.
Editing
(
state
.
mode
.
selectedItems
+
action
.
item
)
)
}
.
.
.
}
}
This
reduces
the
number
of
layers
in
the
code
path
.
Note
also
that
business
logic
around
whether
to
update
based
on
Sync
status
is
incorporated
locally
in
the
Reducer
.
In
this
example
the
details
of
observing
state
from
the
store
are
complicated
by
the
additional
view
hierarchies
required
by
recycler
views
so
they
have
been
omitted
for
brevity
.
#
#
#
Moving
into
the
future
:
using
lib
-
state
with
Compose
Ideally
fragments
or
top
-
level
views
/
Composables
would
register
observers
of
their
Store
'
s
state
and
send
updates
from
those
observers
to
their
child
Composables
along
with
closures
containing
dispatches
to
those
Stores
.
We
are
already
close
to
being
familiar
with
this
pattern
in
some
places
.
The
following
is
a
current
example
that
has
been
edited
for
brevity
and
clarity
:
kotlin
class
PocketCategoriesViewHolder
(
composeView
:
ComposeView
viewLifecycleOwner
:
LifecycleOwner
private
val
interactor
:
PocketStoriesInteractor
)
:
ComposeViewHolder
(
composeView
viewLifecycleOwner
)
{
Composable
override
fun
Content
(
)
{
val
categories
=
components
.
appStore
.
observeAsComposableState
{
state
-
>
state
.
pocketStoriesCategories
}
.
value
val
categoriesSelections
=
components
.
appStore
.
observeAsComposableState
{
state
-
>
state
.
pocketStoriesCategoriesSelections
}
.
value
PocketTopics
(
categoryColors
=
categoryColors
categories
=
categories
?
:
emptyList
(
)
categoriesSelections
=
categoriesSelections
?
:
emptyList
(
)
onCategoryClick
=
interactor
:
:
onCategoryClicked
)
}
}
Here
we
already
see
a
view
registering
Store
observers
appropriately
.
The
only
thing
that
would
need
to
change
is
the
line
calling
the
interactor
onCategoryClick
=
interactor
:
:
onCategoryClicked
.
Following
this
line
leads
down
a
similar
chain
of
abstraction
layers
and
eventually
leads
to
DefaultPocketStoriesController
:
:
handleCategoryClicked
.
This
function
contains
business
logic
which
would
need
to
be
moved
to
the
reducer
and
telemetry
side
-
effects
that
would
need
to
be
moved
to
a
middleware
but
the
ultimate
intent
is
to
toggle
the
selected
category
.
We
skip
many
layers
of
indirection
by
dispatching
that
action
directly
from
the
view
:
kotlin
class
PocketCategoriesViewHolder
(
composeView
:
ComposeView
viewLifecycleOwner
:
LifecycleOwner
)
:
ComposeViewHolder
(
composeView
viewLifecycleOwner
)
{
Composable
override
fun
Content
(
)
{
val
categories
=
components
.
appStore
.
observeAsComposableState
{
state
-
>
state
.
pocketStoriesCategories
}
.
value
val
categoriesSelections
=
components
.
appStore
.
observeAsComposableState
{
state
-
>
state
.
pocketStoriesCategoriesSelections
}
.
value
PocketTopics
(
categoryColors
=
categoryColors
categories
=
categories
?
:
emptyList
(
)
categoriesSelections
=
categoriesSelections
?
:
emptyList
(
)
onCategoryClick
=
{
name
-
>
components
.
appStore
.
dispatch
(
AppAction
.
TogglePocketStoriesCategory
(
name
)
)
}
)
}
}
This
should
simplify
the
search
for
underlying
logic
by
:
-
moving
business
logic
into
an
expected
and
consistent
component
(
the
reducer
)
-
moving
side
-
effects
into
a
consistent
and
centralized
component
(
a
middleware
which
could
even
handle
telemetry
for
the
entire
store
)
#
#
#
Extending
the
example
:
separating
state
and
side
-
effects
To
demonstrate
the
bullets
above
here
is
the
method
definition
in
the
DefaultPocketStoriesController
that
currently
handles
the
business
logic
initiated
from
the
interactor
:
:
onCategoryClicked
call
above
.
override
fun
handleCategoryClick
(
categoryClicked
:
PocketRecommendedStoriesCategory
)
{
val
initialCategoriesSelections
=
appStore
.
state
.
pocketStoriesCategoriesSelections
/
/
First
check
whether
the
category
is
clicked
to
be
deselected
.
if
(
initialCategoriesSelections
.
map
{
it
.
name
}
.
contains
(
categoryClicked
.
name
)
)
{
appStore
.
dispatch
(
AppAction
.
DeselectPocketStoriesCategory
(
categoryClicked
.
name
)
)
Pocket
.
homeRecsCategoryClicked
.
record
(
Pocket
.
HomeRecsCategoryClickedExtra
(
categoryName
=
categoryClicked
.
name
newState
=
"
deselected
"
selectedTotal
=
initialCategoriesSelections
.
size
.
toString
(
)
)
)
return
}
/
/
If
a
new
category
is
clicked
to
be
selected
:
/
/
Ensure
the
number
of
categories
selected
at
a
time
is
capped
.
val
oldestCategoryToDeselect
=
if
(
initialCategoriesSelections
.
size
=
=
POCKET_CATEGORIES_SELECTED_AT_A_TIME_COUNT
)
{
initialCategoriesSelections
.
minByOrNull
{
it
.
selectionTimestamp
}
}
else
{
null
}
oldestCategoryToDeselect
?
.
let
{
appStore
.
dispatch
(
AppAction
.
DeselectPocketStoriesCategory
(
it
.
name
)
)
}
/
/
Finally
update
the
selection
.
appStore
.
dispatch
(
AppAction
.
SelectPocketStoriesCategory
(
categoryClicked
.
name
)
)
Pocket
.
homeRecsCategoryClicked
.
record
(
Pocket
.
HomeRecsCategoryClickedExtra
(
categoryName
=
categoryClicked
.
name
newState
=
"
selected
"
selectedTotal
=
initialCategoriesSelections
.
size
.
toString
(
)
)
)
}
If
we
break
this
down
into
a
pseudocode
algorithm
we
get
the
following
steps
:
1
.
Read
the
current
state
from
the
store
2
.
If
the
category
is
being
deselected
1
.
Dispatch
an
action
to
update
the
state
2
.
Record
a
metric
that
the
category
was
deselected
3
.
Return
early
3
.
If
the
number
of
categories
selected
would
be
over
max
1
.
Dispatch
an
action
deselecting
the
oldest
4
.
Dispatch
an
action
with
the
newly
selected
category
5
.
Record
a
metric
that
a
category
was
selected
In
order
to
transform
this
algorithm
into
an
appropriate
usage
of
the
Redux
pattern
we
can
separate
this
list
into
two
parts
:
steps
that
have
side
-
effects
and
steps
which
can
be
represented
by
pure
state
updates
.
In
this
case
only
the
steps
that
record
metrics
represent
side
-
effects
.
This
will
mean
that
those
steps
should
be
moved
into
a
middleware
and
the
rest
can
be
moved
into
a
reducer
.
Here
'
s
how
that
might
look
:
kotlin
/
/
add
a
new
AppAction
data
class
TogglePocketStoriesCategory
(
val
categoryName
:
String
)
:
AppAction
(
)
/
/
add
a
case
to
handle
it
in
a
middleware
.
For
example
let
'
s
put
the
following
in
MetricsMiddleware
:
private
fun
handleAction
(
action
:
AppAction
)
=
when
(
action
)
{
.
.
.
is
AppAction
.
TogglePocketStoriesCategory
-
>
{
val
currentCategoriesSelections
=
currentState
.
pocketStoriesCategoriesSelections
.
map
{
it
.
name
}
/
/
check
if
the
category
is
being
deselected
if
(
currentCategoriesSelections
.
contains
(
action
.
categoryName
)
)
{
Pocket
.
homeRecsCategoryClicked
.
record
(
Pocket
.
HomeRecsCategoryClickedExtra
(
categoryName
=
action
.
categoryName
newState
=
"
deselected
"
selectedTotal
=
currentCategoriesSelections
.
size
.
toString
(
)
)
)
}
else
{
Pocket
.
homeRecsCategoryClicked
.
record
(
Pocket
.
HomeRecsCategoryClickedExtra
(
categoryName
=
action
.
categoryName
newState
=
"
selected
"
selectedTotal
=
currentCategoriesSelections
.
size
.
toString
(
)
)
)
}
}
}
/
/
finally
we
can
shift
all
the
state
updating
logic
into
the
reducer
fun
reduce
(
state
:
AppState
action
:
AppAction
)
:
AppState

Interacting
with
the
storage
layer
through
middlewares
What
if
a
feature
requires
some
async
data
for
its
initial
state
or
needs
to
write
changes
to
disk
?
There
are
no
restrictions
on
running
impure
methods
in
middleware
so
we
can
respond
to
an
actions
that
would
imply
changes
to
the
storage
layer
from
middlewares
.
A
good
example
is
[
ContainerMiddleware
]
(

Note
that
the
InitAction
here
subscribes
to
a
Flow
from
the
database
which
will
continue
to
collect
updates
from
the
storage
layer
and
dispatch
actions
to
change
the
state
accordingly
.
Overall
this
should
convey
the
following
improvements
-
All
state
updates
are
guaranteed
to
be
pure
and
in
a
single
component
allowing
for
easy
testing
and
reproduction
-
All
side
-
effects
are
logically
grouped
into
middlewares
allowing
for
testing
strategies
specific
to
the
type
of
side
-
effect
-
Several
indirect
abstraction
layers
are
removed
minimizing
mental
model
of
code
#
#
Drawbacks
Redux
-
like
patterns
have
a
bit
of
a
learning
curve
and
some
problems
can
be
more
difficult
to
solve
than
others
.
For
example
handling
side
-
effects
like
navigation
or
loading
state
from
disk
.
The
benefits
of
streamlining
our
architecture
should
outweigh
this
especially
once
demonstrative
examples
of
solving
these
problems
are
common
in
the
codebase
.
