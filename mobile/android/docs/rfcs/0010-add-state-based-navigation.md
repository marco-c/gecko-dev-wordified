Fenix
should
have
a
method
of
navigation
that
is
tied
to
the
lib
-
state
model
to
provide
a
method
of
handling
navigation
side

effects
that
is
consistent
with
architectural
goals

Motivation
Currently
methods
of
navigation
throughout
the
app
are
varied
.
The
SessionControlController
provides

alone
:
-
HomeActivity
:
:
openToBrowserAndLoad
-
Calling
a
NavController
directly
-
Callbacks
like
showTabTray
(
)
To
move
to
a
more
consistent
Store
model
we
need
a
way
for
features
to
fire
Action
s
and
have
that
result
in
navigation
.
This
has
the
added
benefit
of
decoupling
our
business
logic
from
Android
platform
implementation
details
.
#

Proposal
There
are
two
cases
to
consider
for
navigation
state
:
the
currently
displayed
fragment
and
transient
UI
like
CFRs
dialogs
etc
.
For
screens
:
add
a
Screen
property
to
AppStore
and
react
to
changes
by
observing
them
in
a
navigation
AbstractBinding
hosted
by
the
HomeActivity
.
This
is
roughly
equivalent
to
the
Navigator
[
implementation
in
Focus
]
(

.
Handling
this
State
in
AppStore
should
allow
us
to
have
a
consistent
touch
point
for
all
navigation
since
this
Store
is
globally
accessible
.
For
transient
state
:
For
now
I
am
proposing
to
implement
feature
-
or
screen
-
specific
middleware
that
consume
actions
to
directly
tie
them
to
their
side
-
effects
.
#
#
Alternatives
#
#
#
For
screens
:
One
big
alternative
consideration
is
:
do
we
want
to
track
nav
State
in
the
Store
at
all
?
It
is
potentially
error
-
prone
or
repetitious
of
other
code
(
nav
-
graph
and
the
code
that
actually
invokes
the
NavController
)
.
The
main
alternative
would
be
to
handle
navigation
in
middleware
as
a
reaction
to
Action
s
but
options
for
this
come
with
there
own
set
of
challenges
:
1
.
Global
navigation
middleware
attached
to
the
AppStore
.
This
is
made
more
difficult
because
we
do
not
have
access
to
an
Activity
context
(
to
retrieve
a
NavController
from
)
when
instantiating
the
AppStore
in
Component
s
.
We
could
create
a
mutable
getter
/
setter
for
the
Middleware
'
s
NavController
but
this
carries
risks
for
things
like
race
conditions
public
mutability
and
null
accesses
if
the
Middleware
held
a
dangling
reference
to
a
null
activity
after
destructive
lifecycle
events
.
2
.
Individual
navigation
middleware
attached
to
each
Fragment
'
s
Store
.
This
carries
risk
of
repetition
and
boilerplate
.
#
#
#
For
transient
UI
state
:
1
.
Focus
handles
some
cases
of
this
similarly
to
screens
.
There
are
examples
in
of
CFRs
in
[
Focus
'
AppState
]
(

)
for
example
.
This
is
potentially
more
in
line
with
the
proposal
to
add
a
Screen
property
but
it
carries
its
own
risks
:
1
.
State
must
be
consumed
correctly
or
configuration
changes
can
cause
effects
like
dialogs
or
CFRs
to
erroneously
re
-
display
.
2
.
It
suffers
from
the
main
drawback
of
the
Screen
proposal
in
that
we
introduce
additional
code
to
track
what
should
be
treated
as
a
side
-
effect
(
and
therefore
handled
by
middleware
)
.
