in
your
app
then
you
should
refer

To

specifically
you
will
need

additional
information
.

To
ensure
that
your
patch
does
not
break
existing
functionality
in
GeckoView
you
can
run
the
junit
test
suite
with
the
following
command
:
:
.
/
mach
geckoview
-
junit
This
command
also
allows
you
to
run
individual
tests

you
should
run

note
for

If
the
patch
that
you
want
to
submit
changes
the
public
API
for
GeckoView
you
must
ensure
that
the
API
documentation
is
kept
up
to
date
.
To
check
whether
your
patch
has
altered
the
API
run
the
following
command
.
.
.
code
:
:
bash
.
/
mach
lint
-
-
linter
android
-
api
-
lint
The
output
of
this
command
will
inform
you
if
any
changes
you
have
made
break
the
existing
API
.
Review
the
changes
and
follow
the
instructions
it
provides
.
If
the
linter
asks
you
to
update
the
changelog
please
ensure
that
you
follow
the
correct
format
for
changelog
entries
.
Under
the
heading
for
the
next
release
version
add
a
new
entry
for
the
changes
that
you
are
making

the

It
is
advisable
to
run
your
tests
before
submitting
your
patch
.
You
can
do
this
using
Mozilla
s
try
server
.
To
submit
a
GeckoView
patch
to
try
before
submitting
it
for
review
type
:
.
.
code
:
:
bash
.
/
mach
try
auto
This
will
automatically
select
tests
to
run
from
our
suite
.
If
your
patch
passes
on
try
you
can
be
(
fairly
)
confident
that
it
will
land
successfully
after
review
.

If
you
don
t
know
who
to
tag
for
a
review
in
the

submission
message
leave
the
field
blank
and
after
submission
follow

Include
GeckoView
as
a
dependency

If
you
want
to
include
a
development
version
of
GeckoView
as
a
dependency
inside
another
app
you
must
link
to
a
local
copy
.
There
are
several
ways
to
achieve
this
but
the
preferred
way
is
to
use
Gradle
s
*
dependency
substitution
*
mechanism
for
which
there
is
first
-
class
support
in
mozilla
-
central
and
a
pattern
throughout
Mozilla
s
GeckoView
-
consuming
ecosystem
.
The
good
news
is
that
mach
build
produces
everything
you
need
so
that
after
the
configuration
below
you
should
find
that
the
following
commands
rebuild
your
local
GeckoView
and
then
consume
your
local
version
in
the
downstream
project
.
.
.
code
:
:
sh
cd
/
path
/
to
/
mozilla
-
central
&
&
.
/
mach
build
cd
/
path
/
to
/
project
&
&
.
/
gradlew
assembleDebug
*
*
Be
sure
that
your
mozconfig
specifies
the
correct
-
-
target
argument
for
your
target
device
.
*
*
Many
projects
use
ABI
splitting
to
include
only
the
target
device
s
native
code
libraries
in
APKs
deployed
to
the
device
.
On
x86
-
64
and
aarch64
devices
this
can
result
in
GeckoView
failing
to
find
any
libraries
because
valid
x86
and
ARM
libraries
were
not
included
in
a
deployed
APK
.
Avoid
this
by
setting
-
-
target
to
the
exact
ABI
that
your
device
supports
.
