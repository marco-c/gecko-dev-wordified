We
use
our
own
preprocessing
to
either
add
or
remove
android
:
debuggable
when
building
with
mach
so
it
'
s
not
actually
hard
-
coded
.
We
can
probably
remove
this
warning
when
we
switch
to
gradle
.

We
want
all
lint
warnings
to
be
fatal
errors
.
Right
now
we
set
these
to
lint
warnings
so
:
DO
NOT
ADD
TO
THIS
LIST
.
We
did
this
so
we
can
land
lint
in
automation
and
not
fail
everything
.
