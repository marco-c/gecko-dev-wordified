Android
Test
Automation
Framework
(
POM
-
Based
)
#
#
Introduction
This
framework
introduces
a
modern
scalable
approach
to
Android
UI
testing
using
the
Page
Object
Model
(
POM
)
.
It
combines
Espresso
UIAutomator2
and
Jetpack
Compose
testing
under
a
single
unified
abstraction
making
test
code
clean
reusable
and
easy
to
maintain
.
Tests
written
with
this
system
read
like
user
journeys
not
code
.
Teams
can
define
pages
once
and
reuse
them
throughout
tests
encouraging
ownership
modularity
and
clarity
across
features
.

*
*
Define
Selectors
*
*
kotlin
val
TITLE
=
Selector
(
strategy
=
SelectorStrategy
.
ESPRESSO_BY_TEXT
value
=
"
Welcome
"
description
=
"
Welcome

Home
Page
"
groups

Create
a

:

(

{

Contributing
When
adding
new
pages
or
selectors
:
-
Follow
the
fluent
interface
pattern
-
Group
selectors
meaningfully
(
e
.
g
.
"
requiredForPage
"
"
toolbar
"
)
-
Register
navigation
paths
explicitly
in
each
Page
'
s
init
block
#
#
Best
Practices
-
Use
clear
readable
selector
descriptions
-
Avoid
direct
interaction
with
Espresso
/
UIAutomator
in
tests
-
Build
tests
in
Given
/
When
/
Then
structure
-
-
-
This
framework
enables
powerful
flexible
testing
but
starts
simple
.
With
it
we
empower
teams
to
own
their
features
*
and
*
their
tests
.
