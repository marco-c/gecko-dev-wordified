Test
Automation
as
a
Service
:
Multi
-
Phase
Strategy
#
#
Overview
This
document
outlines
a
multi
-
phase
strategy
for
building
a
scalable
maintainable
and
dynamic
Android
test
automation
system
.
The
goal
is
to
support
testing
at
scale
ranging
from
dozens
to
tens
of
thousands
of
tests
while
enabling
individual
development
teams
to
own
their
test
logic
confidently
.
The
system
is
designed
not
just
to
enable
automated
UI
tests
but
to
act
as
a
test
orchestration
framework
that
can
:
-
Generate
tests
dynamically
-
Support
efficient
test
suite
creation
and
execution
-
Optimize
coverage
with
minimal
redundancy
-
Allow
runtime
customization
of
test
input
state
and
configuration

Summary
of
Phases

#
*
*
Phase
0
:
Ad
-
Hoc
Testing
*
*
-
Common
pattern
seen
in
early
automation
efforts
or
tutorials
-
Tests
are
brittle
hard
to
maintain
-
Difficult
to
scale
beyond
~
100
-
200
tests
#
#
#
*
*
Phase
1
:
Standardization
with
Page
Object
Model
(
POM
)
*
*
-
Introduce
BasePage
+
Selector
abstractions
for
cross
-
device
/
platform
consistency
-
Define
navigation
flows
using
a
navigation
graph
(
nodes
=
pages
edges
=
steps
)
-
Fluent
interface
pattern
for
clean
and
readable
test
flows
-
Reuse
components
and
improve
stability
-
Targets
~
1
000
to
~
2
000
tests
*
*
Key
Outcomes
:
*
*
-
Reduced
maintenance
overhead
-
Stable
and
composable
test
structure
-
Foundation
for
dynamic
navigation
and
grouped
element
validation
#
#
#
*
*
Phase
2
:
Data
-
Driven
Tests
&
Dynamic
Test
Factories
*
*
-
Use
metadata
and
reflection
to
define
what
each
test
requires
-
Centralized
test
data
service
that
dynamically
prepares
:
-
Test
data
-
Test
environments
-
Targeted
test
suites
based
on
code
changes
-
Enables
composable
on
-
demand
test
generation
-
Replaces
tags
and
decorators
with
runtime
configuration
-
Coverage
optimization
using
Orthogonal
Arrays
(
e
.
g
.
pairwise
testing
)
*
*
Key
Outcomes
:
*
*
-
Tests
generated
from
config
or
runtime
context
-
Faster
feedback
cycles
by
running
most
relevant
tests
first
-
Easier
root
cause
analysis
in
CI
-
Teams
can
define
and
manage
their
own
test
scope

:
Test
Factory

Test
Factories

infrastructure
from
Phases

2
-
Enable
AI
and
/
or
rule
-
based
helpers
to
:
-
Propose
tests
based
on
heuristics
or
code
changes
-
Self
-
heal
flaking
or
broken
tests
-
Minimize
human
intervention
while
scaling
coverage
-
Libraries
for
setup
steps
and
assertions
are
highly
structured
-
Fluent
interfaces
make
automation
predictable
and
parseable
*
*
Key
Outcomes
:
*
*
-
Automation
becomes
intelligent
and
context
-
aware
-
Reduced
cost
of
test
maintenance
and
authoring
-
Human

:
-
BasePage

:
Common
logic
for
all
screens
(
navigation
verification
interaction
)
-
Selector

kt
:
Declarative
wrapper
around
UI
selectors
with

-
NavigationRegistry

kt
:
Graph
structure
for
defining

Why
this
matters
:
*
*
These
modules
abstract
away
repetitive
test
logic
and
create
a
clean
DSL

How
This
Enables
the
Future
-
Pages
describe
their
_structure_
via
selectors
-
Navigation
is
described
declaratively
-
Test
code
focuses
only
on
_what
to
test_
not
_how
to
get
there_
-
Data
-
driven
factories
can
then
define
_what
to
test_
programmatically

#
#
Adding
a
New

extends
BasePage
-
Implement
mozGetSelectorsByGroup
(
)
-
Register
all
navigation
edges
in
init
{
}
block
#
#
#
Creating
a
Dynamic
Test
-
Define
input
data
and
selectors
declaratively
-
Feed
test
data
into
a
factory
that
builds
navigation
+
verification

Final
Thoughts
This
framework
is
not
just
about
making
UI
tests
easier
.
It
s
about
enabling
:
-
Reusable
automation
primitives
-
Team
autonomy
-
Data
-
and
AI
-
assisted
test
generation
-
Long
-
term
maintainability
It
positions
test
automation
as
a
_strategic
capability_
not
just
a
tactical
tool
.
