Write

;
let
the
system
handle
the
mechanics
.

#
#
Purpose
The
*
*
Test
Factory
*
*
prototype
demonstrates
how
test
cases
can
be
built
dynamically
from
declarative
feature
specifications
not
imperative
scripts
.
It
is
a
*
*
teaching
&
transition
tool
*
*
that
makes
the
composition
mechanics
visible
before
we
automate
them
.

Goals
1
.
*
*
Demonstrate
abstraction
*
*
tests
=
navigation
+
action
+
verification
2
.
*
*
Enable
composability
*
*
small
steps
reusable
specs
generated
suites
3
.
*
*
Provide
transparency
*
*
Summary
+
JSONL

4
.
*
*
Reduce
onboarding
friction
*
*
DSL
/
specs
instead
of
raw
code
5

*
Prepare

Educational
Scaffolding
The
features
/
*
specs
and
*
FactoryTest
classes
are
*
*
demo
/
educational
*
*
modules
.
They
show
what
real
data
-
driven
suites
will
look
like
over
the
wire
.
Once
teams
are
comfortable
they
will
be
replaced
or
removed
.
