Our
addition
:
this

is
saved
to
disk
via
Serializable
which
ProGuard
doesn
'
t
like
.
#
If
we
exclude
this
upload
silently
fails
(
Sentry
swallows
a
NPE
so
we
don

crash

The
fast
service
loader
appears
to
be
as
performant
as
the
R8
optimization
so
it
'
s
not
worth
the
#
churn
to
later
remove
this
workaround
.
If
needed
the
upstream
fix
is
being
handled
