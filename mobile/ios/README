iOS
Port
Prototype
The
current
iOS
port
prototype
is
built
in
2
parts
.
The
core
libraries
such
as
XUL
are
built
as
-
normal
and
then
an
xcode
project
is
used
to
bundle
these
libraries
into
an
iOS
application
which
can
be
deployed
to
a
device
or
simulator
.
Currently
there
is
no
support
for
running
automated
iOS
tests
though
this
is
being
investigated
.
