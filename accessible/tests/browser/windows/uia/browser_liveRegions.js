.
The

specify
whether
descendants

expose
this
.

2
.
Chromium
only
exposes
it
on
the
root
.
Given
that
live
regions
work
in

Chromium
but
not
with
the

UIA
proxy
it
makes
sense
to
follow

Chromium
in
the
absence
of
good
documentation
.

.
It
'
s
cheaper
to
expose
it
only
on
the
root
since
that
avoids
many
/

ancestor
walks
