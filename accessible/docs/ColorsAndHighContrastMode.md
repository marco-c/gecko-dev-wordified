Colors
and
High
Contrast
Mode
Firefox
offers
several
customisations
to
improve
the
accessibility
of
colors
used
to
render
web
content
and
Firefox
chrome
.
This
document
describes
the
customisation
options
available
and
their
behaviour
across
platforms
.
It
also
describes
how
these
options
interact
with
one
another
.

Color
Usage
and
System
Colors
Before
we
render
any
Firefox
/
web
content
we
need
to
select
a
color
palette
to
render
that
content
_with_
.
There
are
three
different
sets
of
colors
we
can
use
to
style
Firefox
and
/
or
web
content
:
-
Stand
-
in
colors
-
System
colors
-
Colors
-
dialog
colors
>
Note
:
Web
pages
may
supply
their
palette
through
style
sheets
.
When
FF
HCM
is
set
to
"
On
"
or
set
to
"
Use
platform
'
s
contrast
settings
"
and
OS
HCM
is
enabled
the
chosen
color
palette
is
_forced_
meaning
it
cannot
be
overridden
by
web
pages
.
We
decide
which
set
of
colors
to
use
in
PreferenceSheet
:
:
Load
.
If
resistFingerprinting
is
enabled
we
use
stand
-
in
colors
.
These
colors
are
pre
-
defined
constants
and
are
not
dynamically
fetched
from
the
operating
system
.
Check
out
nsXPLookAndFeel
:
:
GetStandinForNativeColor
for
more
information
as
well
as
the
constants
themselves
.
If
we
aren
'
t
using
stand
-
in
colors
we
'
ll
check
the
browser
.
display
.
document_color_use
pref
.
If
HCM
is
explicitly
off
(
1
)
or
automatically
off
(
0
)
we
will
use
the
system
colors
as
default
text
and
link
colors
.
System
colors
are
colors
queried
from
the
operating
system
.
They
help
Firefox
adapt
to
OS
-
level
changes
that
aren
'
t
strictly
HCM
(
ie
.
light
/
dark
themeing
)
.
Because
these
colors
are
OS
-
dependent
a
user
operating
Firefox
on
a
Windows
machine
with
system
colors
enabled
will
see
Firefox
differently
than
a
user
with
system
colors
enabled
on
MacOS
.
So
how
do
we
_get_
system
colors
?
Our
style
system
has
a
set
of
pre
-
defined
ColorID
'
s
in
ServoStyleConsts
.
h
which
are
mapped
to
platform
-
specific
colors
in
widget
/
[
cocoa
|
android
|
windows
|
gtk
]
/
LookAndFeel
.
cpp
.
Depending
on
the
ColorID
queried
we
may
do
a
dynamic
fetch
or
simply
return
a
constant
.
On
MacOS
for
example
ColorID
:
:
TextForeground
and
ColorID
:
:
TextBackground
are
hard
-
coded
to
return
black
and
white
respectively
.
ColorID
:
:
Highlight
on
the
other
hand
queries
the
OS
for
NSColor
.
selectedTextBackgroundColor
which
is
set
based
on
the
accent
color
a
user
has
selected
in
System
Preferences
.
>
Note
:
The
colors
we
fetch
here
are
theme
-
relative
.
If
a
user
has
set
their
OS
to
a
dark
theme
we
'
ll
fetch
colors
from
that
palette
and
likewise
for
a
light
theme
.
Windows
HCM
though
not
strictly
a
"
theme
"
overrides
the
colors
stored
for
Windows
'

to

If

HCM
Firefox
will
automatically
go
into

mode
as
well
.
>
Note
:
This
is
intentional
.
Windows
HCM
is
the
most
robust
HCM
offered
among
the
operating
systems
we
support
and
so
we
cater
to
it
here
:
)
Users
on
non
-
Windows
platforms
have
HCM
disabled
by
default
(
document_color_use
=
1
)
.
In
order
to
enable
Firefox
HCM
they
will
either
need
to
turn
it
on
explicitly
(
document_color_use
=
2
)
or
set
it
to
use
the
OS
HCM
mode
and
palette
(
document_color_use
=
0
)
.
