:
The

geckodriver
supports
a
couple
of
non

standard
capabilities
to
customise
and
configure
a
Firefox

:

firefox
<

to
select
which
custom
browser
binary
to
use
.
If
left
undefined
geckodriver
will
attempt
to
deduce
the
default
location
of
Firefox
on
the
current
system
.
<

<

firefox_profile
<

For
each
session
geckodriver
creates
a
new
temporary
profile
by
default
.
To
set
custom
preferences
or
use
an
add
-
on
/
extension
you
may
want
to
provide
a
custom
profile
.
A
profile
can
be
sent
across
the
wire
protocol
by
setting
this
capability
to
its
path
on
the
local
filesystem

Building
geckodriver
is
written
in
[
Rust
]
(
https
:
/
/
www
.
rust
-
lang
.
org
/
)
and
you
need
the
Rust
toolchain
to
compile
it
.
To
build
the
project
for
release
ensure
you
do
a
compilation
with
optimisations
:
%
cargo
build
-
-
release
Or
if
you
want
a
non
-
optimised
binary
for
debugging
:
%
cargo
build
