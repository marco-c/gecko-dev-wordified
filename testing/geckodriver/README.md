Proxy
for
using
W3C

compatible
clients
to
interact
with

browsers
.
This
program
provides
the
HTTP
API
described
by
the
[
WebDriver
protocol

Building
geckodriver
is
written
in
[
Rust
]
(
https
:
/
/
www
.
rust
-
lang
.
org
/
)
and
you
need
the
Rust
toolchain
to
compile
it
.
To
compile
the
project
for
release
ensure
you
do
an
optimised
build
:
%
cargo
build
-
-
no
-
default
-
features
-
-
release
If
you
want
to
build
a
debug
binary
:
%
cargo
build
-
-
no
-
default
-
features
The
-
-
no
-
default
-
features
argument
is
required
to
compile
on
Windows
due
to
the
way
dependencies
need
to
be
compiled
.
