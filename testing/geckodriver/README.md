Building
geckodriver
is
written
in
[
Rust
]
(
https
:
/
/
www
.
rust
-
lang
.
org
/
)
and
you
need
the
Rust
toolchain
to
compile
it
.
To
build
the
project
for
release
ensure
you
do
a
compilation
with
optimisations
:
%
cargo
build
-
-
release
Or
if
you
want
a
non
-
optimised
binary
for
debugging
:
%
cargo
build
