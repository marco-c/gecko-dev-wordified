We
verify
and
test
Marionette
in
a
couple
of
different
ways
.
Marionette
has
a
set
of
[
xpcshell
]
unit
tests
located
in
_testing
/
marionette
/
test_
*
.
js_
.
These
can
be
run
this
way
:
%
.
/
mach
test
testing
/
marionette
/
test_
*
.
js
Because
tests
are
run
in
parallell
and
xpcshell
itself
is
quite
chatty
it
can
sometimes
be
useful
to
run
the
tests
sequentially
:
%
.
/
mach
test
-
-
sequential
testing
/
marionette
/
test_error
.
js
These
unit
tests
run
as
part
of
the
_X_
jobs
on
Treeherder
.
We
also
have
a
set
of
functional
tests
that
make
use
of
the
Marionette
Python
client
.
These
start
a
Firefox
process
and
tests
the
Marionette
protocol
input
and
output
.
The
following
command
will
run
all
tests
:
%
.
/
mach
test
mn
But
you
can
also
run
individual
tests
:
%
.
/
mach
test
testing
/
marionette
/
harness
/
marionette_harness
/
tests
/
unit
/
test_navigation
.
py
When
working
on
Marionette
code
it
is
often
useful
to
surface
the
stdout
from
Firefox
:
%
.
/
mach
test
-
-
gecko
-
log
-
TEST
It
is
common
to
use
this
in
conjunction
with
an
option
to
increase
the
Marionette
log
level
:
%
.
/
mach
test
-
-
gecko
-
log
-
-
vv
TEST
A
single
-
v
enables
debug
logging
and
a
double
-
vv
enables
trace
logging
.
As
these
are
functional
integration
tests
and
pop
up
Firefox
windows
sporadically
a
helpful
tip
is
to
surpress
the
window
whilst
you
are
running
them
by
using
Firefox
[
headless
mode
]
:
%
.
/
mach
test
-
z
TEST
-
z
is
an
alias
for
-
-
headless
and
equivalent
to
setting
the
MOZ_HEADLESS
output
variable
.
In
addition
to
MOZ_HEADLESS
there
is
also
MOZ_HEADLESS_WIDTH
and
MOZ_HEADLESS_HEIGHT
for
controlling
the
dimensions
of
the
no
-
op
virtual
display
.
This
is
similar
to
using
xvfb
(
1
)
which
you
may
know
from
the
X
windowing
system
but
has
the
additional
benefit
of
also
working
on
macOS
and
Windows
.
We
have
a
separate
page
documenting
how
to
write
good
Python
tests
in
<
doc
/
PythonTests
.
md
>
.
These
tests
will
run
as
part
of
the
_Mn_
job
on
Treeherder
.
In
addition
to
these
two
test
types
that
specifically
test
the
Marionette
protocol
Marionette
is
used
as
the
backend
for
the
[
geckodriver
]
WebDriver
implementation
.
It
is
served
by
a
WPT
test
suite
which
effectively
tests
conformance
to
the
W3C
specification
.
This
is
a
good
try
syntax
to
use
when
testing
Marionette
