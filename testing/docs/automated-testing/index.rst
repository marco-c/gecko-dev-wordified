You
'
ve
just
written
a
feature
and
(
hopefully
!
)
want
to
test
it
.
Or
you
'
ve
decided
that
an
existing
feature
doesn
'
t
have
enough
tests
and
want
to
contribute
some
.
But
where
do
you
start
?
You
'
ve
looked
around
and
found
references
to
things
like
"
xpcshell
"
or
"
web
-
platform
-
tests
"
or
"
talos
"
.
What
code
features
or
platforms
do
they
all
test
?
Where
do
their
feature
sets
overlap
?
In
short
where
should
your
new
tests
go
?
This
document
is
a
starting
point
for
those
who
want
to
start
to
learn
about
Mozilla
'
s
automated

'
ll
find
a
short
summary
of
each
framework
we
use

some
questions

the
framework
(
s
)
you
need
for
your
purposes
.

Not

tests
will
be
run
on
every
changeset
;
alogrithms
are
put
in
place
to
run
the
most
likely
failures
with
all
tests
being
run
on
a
regular
basis
.
They
can
also
be
run
on
local
builds
