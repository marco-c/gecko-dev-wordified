Browser
chrome
mochitests
are
mochitests
that
run
in
the
context
of
the
desktop
Firefox
browser
window
.
The
test
files
are
named
browser_something
.
js
by
convention
and
in
addition
to
mochitest
assertions
supports
the
[
CommonJS
standard
assertions
]
(

like

assert
module
]
(

)
but
implemented
in
[
Assert
.
sys
.
mjs
]
(
.
.
/
assert
.
rst
)
.
These
tests
are
used
to
test
UI
-
related
behaviour
in
Firefox
for
Desktop
.
They
do
not
run
on
Android
.
If
you
'
re
testing
internal
code
that
does
not
directly
interact
with
the
user
interface
[
xpcshell
tests
]
(
.

)
are
probably
a
better
fit
for
your
needs
.
Running
the
tests
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
You
can
run
individual
tests
locally
using
the
standard
.
/
mach
test
command
:
.
/
mach
test
path
/
to
/
browser_test
.
js
.
You
can
omit
the
path
if
the
filename
is
unique
.
You
can
also
run
entire
directories
or
specific
test
manifests
:
.
/
mach
test
path
/
to
/
browser
.
toml
You
can
also
use
the
more
specific
.
/
mach
mochitest
command
in
the
same
way
.
Using
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
help
will
give
you
an
exhaustive
overview
of
useful
other
available
flags
relating
to
running
debugging
and
evaluating
tests
.
For
both
commands
you
can
use
the
-
-
verify
flag
to
run
the
test
under
[
test
verification
]
(
.
.
/
test
-
verification
/
index
.
rst
)
.
This
helps
flush
out
intermittent
issues
with
the
test
.
On
our
infrastructure
these
tests
run
in
the
mochitest
-
browser
-
chrome
jobs
.
There
they
run
on
a
per
-
manifest
basis
(
so
for
most
manifests
more
than
one
test
will
run
while
the
browser
stays
open
)
.
The
tests
also
get
run
in
verify
mode
in
the
test
-
verify
jobs
whenever
the
test
itself
is
changed
.
Note
that
these
tests
use
"
real
"
focus
and
input
so
you
'
ll
need
to
not
touch
your
machine
while
running
them
.
You
can
run
them
with
the
-
-
headless
flag
to
avoid
this
but
some
tests
may
break
in
this
mode
.
Adding
new
tests
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
You
can
use
the
standard
.
/
mach
addtest
path
/
to
/
new
/
browser_test
.
js
command
to
generate
a
new
browser
test
and
add
it
to
the
relevant
manifest
if
tests
already
exist
in
that
directory
.
This
automatically
creates
a
test
file
using
the
right
template
for
you
and
adds
it
to
the
manifest
.
If
there
are
no
tests
in
the
directory
yet
(
for
example
for
an
entirely
new
feature
and
directory
)
you
will
need
to
:
1
.
create
an
empty
browser
.
toml
file
2
.
add
it
to
BROWSER_CHROME_MANIFESTS
collection
from
a
moz
.
build
file
.
3
.
then
run
the
.
/
mach
addtest
command
as
before
.
In
terms
of
the
contents
of
the
test
please
see

Debugging
tests
-

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
The
.
/
mach
test
and
.
/
mach
mochitest
commands
support
a
-
-
jsdebugger
flag
which
will
open
the
browser
toolbox
.
If
you
add
the
[
debugger
;
keyword
]
(
https

.

/

-
US
/

/

/
debugger
)
in
your
test
the
debugger
will
pause
there
.
Alternatively
you
can
set
breakpoints
using
the
debugger
yourself
.
If
you
want
to
pause
the
debugger
before
running
the
test
you
can
use
the
-
-
no
-
autorun
flag
.
It
'
s
also
useful
to
be
able
to
switch
to
the
Network
Monitor
panel
before
the
tests
start
.
Alternatively
if
you
want
to
pause
the
debugger
on
failure
you
can
use
-
-
debug
-
on
-
failure
.

Profiling
tests

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
The
.
/
mach
test
and
.
/
mach
mochitest
commands
also
support
a
-
-
profiler
flag
that
will
start
the
Firefox
Profiler
before
running
tests
.
It
'
s
possible
to
get
a
profile
also
on
try
with
-
-
env
MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP
=
1
:
.
/
mach
try
fuzzy
-
-
env
MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP
=
1
<
test
directory
>
The
profile
will
be
uploaded
in
case
of
a
failure
only
so
make
sure
to
add
something
such
as
ok
(
false
"
force
profile
upload
"
)
;
in
your
test
to
force
the
failure
.
