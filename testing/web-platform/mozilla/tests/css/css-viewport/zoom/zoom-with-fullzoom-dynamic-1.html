This
test
verifies
that
css
'
zoom
'
properly
stacks
with
full
-
page
zoom
in
subdocuments
particularly
when
the
full
-
page
-
zoom
is
dynamically
adjusted
after
pageload
.
This
test
has
a
3x
css
-
zoom
that
gets
applied
to
the
iframe
which
combines
with
a
5x
css
-
zoom
on
the
root
node
inside
the
iframe
;
and
then
after
flushing
paints
this
test
adds
an
additional
2x
full
-
page
-
zoom
factor
.
This
test
'
s
expectation
is
that
these
zoom
factors
all
stack
to

If
