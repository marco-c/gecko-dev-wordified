#
Tests
here
may
time
out
because
the
test
relies
on
onload
being
fired
.
#
This
doesn
'
t
happen
for
JSON
therefore
the
JSON
test
will
always
timeout
.
#
Bug
1888756
implements
this
feature
and
makes
sure
that
this
actually
works
#
even
if
the
tests
fail
.
#
ALl
other
test
cases
are
marked
as
[
PASS
TIMEOUT
]
because
there
are
some
#
treeherder
configs
that
are
so
slow
that
they
run
into
the
3000ms
timeout
.
#
As
the
last
test
will
always
timeout
increasing
the
timeout
does
not
help
#
(
it
'
s
only
possible
to
extend
it
to
be
"
long
"
which
means
1
minute
)
.
