When
'
hyphens
'
is
set
to
'
manual
'
and
applied
to
an
inline
element
then
words
can
be
hyphenated
only
if
characters
inside
the
words
explicitly
define
hyphenation
opportunities
.
In
this
test
the
characters
inside
the
word
'
Deoxyribonucleic
'
explicitly
define
4
hyphenation
opportunities
.
Since
'
Deoxy
'
has
5
characters
and
'
Deoxyribo
'
has
9
characters
and
since
the
content
width
of
the
block
box
can
take
8
characters
then
a
soft
hyphen
will
occur
after
'
Deoxy
'
.
Since
'
ribonu
'
has
6
characters
and
'
ribonucleic
'
has
11
characters
and
since
the
content
width
of
the
block
box
can
take
8
characters
then
a
soft
hyphen
will
occur
after
'
ribonu
'
.
