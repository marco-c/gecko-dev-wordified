It
seems
the
results
are
different
in
different
browsers
:
/
/
Gecko
serializes
this
as
"
match
-
element
"
/
/
WebKit
doesn
'
t
serialize
this
i
.
e
.
empty
string
.
/
/
However
it
seems
"
match
-
element
"
makes
more
sense
so
we
use
it
as
the
/
/
result
.
Also
auto
keyword
is
still
under
discussion
so
we
don
'
t
include
it
/
/
for
now
.
