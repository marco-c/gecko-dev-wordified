Syntax
tests
can
be
found
in
the
"
valid
"
and
"
invalid
"
directories
.
These
are
syntax
tests
for
a
Web
IDL
parser
.
A
correct
parser
should
fail
on
the
tests
in
the
"
invalid
"
directory
and
should
be
able
to
collect
the
data
necessary
to
generate
the
XML
serialization
for
valid
fragments
collected
in
the
"
valid
"
directory
.
(
The
said
XML
serialization
is
the
one
produced
by
[

(

from
which
