Chrome
for
Android
To
run
WPT
on
Chrome
on
an
Android
device
some
additional
set
up
is
required
.
As
with
usual
Android
development
you
need
to
have
adb
and
be
able
to
connect
to
the
device
.
Run
adb
devices
to
verify
.
Currently
Android
support
is
a
prototype
with
some
known
issues
:
*
We
install
ChromeDriver
corresponding
to
the
Chrome
version
on
your
*
host
*
so
you
will
need
a
special
flag
to
bypass
ChromeDriver
'
s
version
check
if
the
test
device
runs
a
different
version
of
Chrome
from
your
host
.
*
The
package
name
is
hard
coded
.
If
you
are
testing
a
custom
build
you
will
need
to
search
and
replace
com
.
android
.
chrome
in
tools
/
.
*
We
do
not
support
reftests
at
the
moment
.
Note
:
rooting
the
device
or
installing
a
root
CA
is
no
longer
required
.
Example
:
