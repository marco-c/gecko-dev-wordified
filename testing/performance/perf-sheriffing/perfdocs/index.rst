dealt
with
.
They
look
at
data
and
performance
metrics
produced
by
the
performance
testing
frameworks
and
find
regression
determine
the
root
cause
and
get
bugs
on
file
to

Whenever
we
get
a
performance
change
we
classify
it
as
one
of
two
things
either
a
regression
or
an
improvement
.
An
improvement
makes
the
performance
better
while
a
regression
makes
something
perform
worse
.
