Modified
for

multi
-
recording
playback
with
diagnostic
logging
.
#
Behaviors
that
differ
from
upstream
serverplayback
:
#
*
On
a
request
with
no
matching
recorded
flow
return
404
(
when
#
alt_server_replay_kill_extra
=
true
)
instead
of
letting
the
flow
drop
#
and
the
client
hang
.
#
*
Optional
reverse
-
order
replay
(
alt_server_replay_order_reversed
)
for
#
tests
that
need
newest
-
first
matching
.
#
*
Loads
multiple
recordings
into
a
single
flowmap
tracks
origin
file
#
per
flow
and
emits
structured
logging
for
every
request
so
that
#
hangs
and
missing
-
resource
bugs
are
diagnosable
