PRemoteWorkerDebuggerManager
is
used
to
register
a

(
PRemoteWorkerDebuggerParent
)
for
a
Worker
.
It
is
a
IPC
between
the

process
main
thread
and
the
Content
process
WorkerLauncher
thread
because
/
/
when
construting
a
Worker
there
is
no
directly
IPC
can
be
reused
to
directly
/
/
build
up
the
IPC
between
the
Parent
process
main
thread
and
the
Content

process
Worker
thread
.
However
the
remote
WorkerDebugger
unregistration
is
/

done
by
PRemoteWorkerDebugger
itself
so
PRemoteWorkerDebuggeManager
has
no
