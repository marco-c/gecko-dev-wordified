Mochitests
are
executed
in
iframes
.
Several
ServiceWorker
tests
use
iframes
#
too
.
The
result
is
that
we
have
nested
iframes
.
CookieBehavior
4

(
BEHAVIOR_REJECT_TRACKER
)
doesn
'
t
grant
storage
access
permission
to
nested
#
iframes
because
trackers
could
use
them
to
follow
users
across
sites
.
Let
