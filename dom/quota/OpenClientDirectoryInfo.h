class
OpenClientDirectoryInfo
*
brief
Prepares
for
handle
-
based
tracking
of
origin
directory
access
.
*
*
OpenClientDirectoryInfo
is
a
lightweight
internal
helper
introduced
in
*
preparation
for
transitioning
origin
access
time
tracking
from
being
lock
*
based
to
handle
-
based
.
*
*
It
tracks
the
number
of
active
ClientDirectoryLockHandle
instances
*
associated
with
an
origin
directory
.
Once
integrated
it
will
allow
*
QuotaManager
to
update
origin
metadata
(
such
as
access
time
)
when
the
first
*
handle
is
created
and
the
last
one
is
released
.
*
*
Although
this
class
is
currently
focused
on
tracking
origin
-
level
access
it
*
may
be
extended
in
the
future
to
track
finer
-
grained
access
to
individual
*
client
directories
as
well
.
The
name
reflects
its
connection
to
the
broader
*
OpenClientDirectory
mechanism
which
is
central
to
how
quota
clients
*
initiate
access
to
their
storage
.
*
*
#
#
Usage
:
*
-
Will
be
created
by
QuotaManager
when
a
ClientDirectoryLockHandle
is
*
registered
(
via
RegisterClientDirectoryLockHandle
)
.
*
-
Will
be
removed
when
the
last
handle
is
unregistered
.
*
-
Not
yet
connected
to
OpenClientDirectory
or
live
handle
usage
.
*
*
#
#
Lifetime
:
*
-
Exists
only
while
at
least
one
ClientDirectoryLockHandle
is
active
for
the
*
origin
directory
.
*
*
#
#
Threading
:
*
-
Must
be
used
only
on
the
thread
that
created
it
.
*
-
AssertIsOnOwningThread
(
)
can
be
used
to
verify
correct
usage
.
