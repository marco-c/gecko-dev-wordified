Directory
Metadata
File
Format
(
.
metadata
-
v2
)
*
*
The
metadata
file
is
a
binary
file
containing
metadata
information
for
an
*
origin
directory
.
It
consists
of
a
header
and
several
additional
fields
*
some
of
which
are
maintained
only
for
backward
compatibility
.
*
*
Header
(
OriginStateMetadata
)
:
*
-
int64_t
mLastAccessTime
*
The
last
access
time
of
the
origin
in
microseconds
since
the
epoch
.
*
-
bool
mPersisted
*
True
if
the
origin
is
marked
as
persisted
and
should
survive
origin
*
eviction
.
*
-
uint32_t
flags
*
A
bitfield
of
DirectoryMetadataFlags
used
to
store
boolean
state
flags
.
*
This
field
currently
maps
only
to
mAccessed
.
The
defined
flags
are
:
*
-
Initialized
:
Always
set
when
writing
metadata
;
indicates
that
this
*
field
contains
valid
flag
bits
.
Older
files
written
before
this
*
flag
was
introduced
will
have
this
field
set
to
zero
.
*
-
Accessed
:
Indicates
whether
the
origin
has
been
accessed
by
a
quota
*
client
.
This
maps
directly
to
the
mAccessed
field
in
memory
.
*
*
If
the
Initialized
flag
is
not
set
the
flags
field
is
considered
*
invalid
and
mAccessed
is
conservatively
set
to
true
to
ensure
a
full
*
initialization
scan
.
*
-
int32_t
mLastMaintenanceDate
*
The
last
maintenance
date
of
the
origin
in
days
since
the
epoch
.
*
*
Legacy
fields
(
still
written
and
read
for
backward
compatibility
but
no
*
longer
used
)
:
*
-
nsCString
mSuffix
*
Originally
used
for
origin
attributes
.
Still
written
to
preserve
*
compatibility
.
*
-
nsCString
mGroup
*
Originally
used
for
quota
group
.
Still
written
to
preserve
*
compatibility
.
*
*
Storage
fields
:
*
-
nsCString
mStorageOrigin
*
Storage
origin
string
(
actively
used
for
reconstructing
the
principal
)
.
*
*
Legacy
fields
(
continued
)
:
*
-
bool
mIsPrivate
*
Flag
originally
used
for
private
browsing
contexts
or
apps
.
Still
*
written
.
*
*
Validation
check
:
*
-
After
reading
all
expected
fields
any
additional
data
(
even
a
single
*
32
-
bit
value
)
is
treated
as
an
error
.
*
*
Notes
:
*
-
OriginStateMetadata
is
loaded
first
and
interpreted
independently
.
This
*
allows
fast
and
safe
updates
to
the
metadata
header
on
disk
without
*
rewriting
the
full
file
.
*
-
The
header
is
intentionally
designed
to
contain
only
fixed
-
size
fields
.
*
This
allows
updating
the
header
in
-
place
without
creating
a
temporary
*
file
.
