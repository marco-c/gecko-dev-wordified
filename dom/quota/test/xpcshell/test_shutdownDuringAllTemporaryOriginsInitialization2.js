This
test
verifies
the
behavior
when
a
shutdown
occurs
during
the
*
initialization
of
all
temporary
origins
in
the
background
.
*
*
Test
Setup
&
Procedure
:
*
1
.
Lazy
Origin
Initialization
Enabled
*
-
The
test
runs
with
lazy
origin
initialization
enabled
meaning
that
*
calling
Services
.
qms
.
initTemporaryStorage
does
not
initialize
*
individual
origins
.
*
*
2
.
Preparation
of
Existing
Profile
*
-
Two
origins
belonging
to
different
eTLD
+
1
groups
are
created
.
*
*
3
.
Triggering
Initialization
of
All
Temporary
Origins
*
-
The
test
explicitly
triggers
the
initialization
of
all
temporary
*
origins
by
calling
Services
.
qms
.
initializeAllTemporaryOrigins
.
*
*
4
.
Inducing
a
Controlled
Shutdown
*
-
The
test
waits
for
the
first
origin
to
begin
initialization
.
*
-
Once
initialization
starts
shutdown
is
triggered
.
*
-
A
2
-
second
delay
is
introduced
in
origin
initialization
to
ensure
*
the
shutdown
signal
has
time
to
propagate
.
*
*
5
.
Expected
Behavior
&
Verification
*
-
Due
to
the
shutdown
the
second
origin
does
not
initialize
.
*
-
Since
active
operations
are
not
available
during
shutdown
the
test
*
verifies
the
shutdown
behavior
by
waiting
for
the
initialization
of
*
all
temporary
origins
to
finish
and
expecting
an
exception
.
*
-
The
operation
is
expected
to
fail
with
NS_ERROR_ABORT
.
*
*
Notes
&
Justification
:
*
-
This
approach
has
been
successfully
used
in
other
tests
to
handle
*
shutdown
scenarios
.
