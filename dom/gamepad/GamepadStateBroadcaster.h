Implements
single

broadcaster
multi

receiver
shared
memory
for
the
gamepad

system
.
Allows
the
gamepad
monitor
thread
in
the
main
process
to
directly
/
/
update
the
shared
memory
to
the
latest
state
and
trigger
an
event
in
all
/
/
the
content
processes
causing
them
to
read
the
shared
memory
and
pass
it
/
/
to
Javascript
.
/
/
This
takes
advantage
of
the
fact
that
gamepad
clients
generally
only
care
/
/
about
the
most
recent
state
of
the
gamepad
not
the
stuff
that
happened
/
/
while
they
weren
'
t
looking
.

This
currently
only
does
anything
interesting
on
Windows

it
uses
