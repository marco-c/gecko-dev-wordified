Test
that
empty
animations
actually
start
.
/
/
/
/
Normally
we
tie
the
start
of
animations
to
when
their
first
frame
of
/
/
the
animation
is
rendered
.
However
for
animations
that
don
'
t
actually
/
/
trigger
a
paint
(
e
.
g
.
because
they
are
empty
or
are
animating
something
/
/
that
doesn
'
t
render
or
is
offscreen
)
we
want
to
make
sure
they
still
/
/
start
.
/
/
/
/
Before
we
start
wait
for
the
document
to
finish
loading
.
This
is
because
/
/
during
loading
we
will
have
other
paint
events
taking
place
which
might
/
/
by
luck
happen
to
trigger
animations
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
/
/
triggered
leading
to
false
positives
.
/
/
/
/
As
a
result
it
'
s
better
to
wait
until
we
have
a
more
stable
state
before
/
/
continuing
.

We
need
to
wait
for
up
to
three
frames
.
This
is
because
in
some
/
/
cases
it
can
take
up
to
two
frames
for
the
initial
layout
/
/
to
take
place
.
Even
after
that
happens
we
don
'
t
actually
resolve
the
/
/
ready
promise
until
the
following
tick
.
return

Test
that

get

correctly

NOTE
:
It

important
that
we
DON

T
use

SpecialPowers
.
DOMWindowUtils
.
advanceTimeAndRefresh
here
since
that
takes
/
/
us
through
a
different
code
path
.
promise_test
(

As
with
the
above
test
any
stray
paints
can
cause
this
test
to
produce
/
/
a
false
negative
(
that
is
pass
when
it
should
fail
)
.
To
avoid
this
we
/
/
first
wait
for
the
document
to
load
then
wait
until
it
is
idle
then
wait
/
/
for
paints
and
only
then
do
we
commence
the
test
.
Even
doing
that
this
/
/
test
can
sometimes
pass
when
it
should
not
due
to
a
stray
paint
.
Most
of
/
/
the
time
however
it
will
correctly
fail
so
hopefully
even
if
we
do
/
/
occasionally
produce
a
false
negative
on
one
platform
another
platform
/
/
will
fail
as
expected
