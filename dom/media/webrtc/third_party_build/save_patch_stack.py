#
First
a
word
about
pre
-
stack
and
normal
patches
.
During
the
    
#
libwebrtc
update
process
there
are
2
cases
where
we
insert
    
#
patches
between
the
upstream
trunk
commit
we
'
re
current
based
on
    
#
and
the
Mozilla
patch
-
stack
:
    
#
1
)
Release
branch
commits
are
frequently
used
.
These
are
patches
    
#
that
are
typically
cherry
-
picks
of
further
upstream
commits
    
#
that
are
needed
to
fix
bugs
in
a
upstream
release
.
When
    
#
beginning
the
Mozilla
libwebrtc
update
process
it
is
necessary
    
#
to
copy
those
release
branch
commits
and
insert
them
between
    
#
the
trunk
commit
we
'
re
based
on
and
the
Mozilla
patch
-
stack
we
    
#
carry
in
order
for
vendoring
to
produce
the
same
result
with
    
#
which
we
ended
the
previous
update
.
    
#
2
)
During
update
process
to
avoid
fixing
/
unfixing
/
refixing
rebase
    
#
conflicts
due
to
upstream
landing
/
reverting
/
relanding
patches
    
#
our
update
scripts
look
ahead
in
the
upstream
commits
for
    
#
reverted
and
relanded
patches
.
If
found
we
insert
the
    
#
reverted
commit
before
our
Mozilla
patch
-
stack
.
This
has
the
    
#
effect
of
creating
a
virtually
empty
commit
for
the
patch
that
    
#
originally
lands
and
then
the
revert
commit
.
Using
this
    
#
technique
allows
us
to
fix
any
potential
rebase
conflicts
when
    
#
the
commit
is
eventually
relanded
the
final
time
.
    
#
    
#
Pre
-
stack
commits
are
everything
that
we
insert
between
upstream
and
    
#
the
Mozilla
patch
-
stack
from
the
two
categories
above
.
    
#
