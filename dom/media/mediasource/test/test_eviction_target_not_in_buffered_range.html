This
test
is
used
to
ensure
that
the
auto
eviction
will
kick
in
after
seeking
/
/
to
a
new
position
which
is
not
in
the
current
buffered
range
and
the
buffer
/
/
is
already
near
full
.
If
we
don
'
t
evict
enough
data
for
this
case
we
would
/
/
not
be
able
to
append
new
data
for
the
new
range
which
contains
the
seek
/
/
target
