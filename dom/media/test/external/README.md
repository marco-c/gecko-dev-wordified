Setup
-
-
-
-
-
Normally
you
get
this
source
by
cloning
a
firefox
repo
such
as
mozilla
-
central
.
The
path
to
these
tests
would
be
in
<
mozilla
-
central
>
/
dom
/
media
/
test
/
external
and
these
instuctions
refer
to
this
path
as
'
PROJECT_HOME
'
.
*
Create
a
virtualenv
called
foo
.
sh
virtualenv
foo
source
foo
/

/
activate
#
or
foo
\
Scripts
\
activate

(
To
get
an
environment
that
is

to
what
is
actually
used
in

Running
the
Tests
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
In
the
examples
below
FF_PATH
is
a
path
to
a
recent
Firefox
binary
.
This
runs
all
the
tests
listed
in
PROJECT_HOME
/
external_media_tests
/
manifest
.
ini
:
sh
external
-
media
-
tests
-
-
binary
FF_PATH
You
can
also
run
all
the
tests
at
a
particular
path
:
sh
external
-
media
-
tests
-
-
binary
FF_PATH
some
/
path
/
foo
Or
you
can
run
the
tests
that
are
listed
in
a
manifest
file
of
your
choice
.
sh
external
-
media
-
tests
-
-
binary
FF_PATH
some
/
other
/
path
/
manifest
.
ini
By
default
the
urls
listed
in
external_media_tests
/
urls
/
default
.
ini
are
used
for
the
tests
but
you
can
also
supply
your
own
ini
file
of
urls
:
sh
external
-
media
-
tests
-
-
binary
FF_PATH
-
-
urls
some
/
other
/
path
/
my_urls
.
ini
#
#
#
Running
EME
tests
In
order
to
run
EME
tests
you
must
use
a
Firefox
profile
that
has
a
signed
plugin
-
container
.
exe
and
voucher
.
bin
.
With
Netflix
this
will
be
created
when
you
log
in
and
save
the
credentials
.
You
must
also
use
a
custom
.
ini
file
for
urls
to
the
provider
'
s
content
and
indicate
which
test
to
run
like
above
.
Ex
:
sh

Running
tests
in
a
way
that
provides
information
about
a
crash
What
if
Firefox
crashes
during
a
test
run
?
You
want
to
know
why
!
To
report
useful
crash
data
the
test
runner
needs
access
to
a
"
minidump_stackwalk
"
binary
and
a
"
symbols
.
zip
"
file
.
1
.
Download
a
minidump_stackwalk
binary
for
your
platform
(
save
it
whereever
)
.
Get
it
from
http
:
/
/
hg
.
mozilla
.
org
/
build
/
tools
/
file
/
tip
/
breakpad
/
.
2
.
Make
minidump_stackwalk
executable
sh
chmod
+
x
path
/
to
/
minidump_stackwalk
3
.
Create
an
environment
variable
called
MINIDUMP_STACKWALK
that
points
to
that
local
path
sh
export
MINIDUMP_STACKWALK
=
path
/
to
/
minidump_stackwalk
4
.
Download
the
crashreporter
-
symbols
.
zip
file
for
the
Firefox
build
you
are
testing
and
extract
it
.

To
check
whether
the
above
setup
is
working
for
you
trigger
a
(
silly
)
Firefox
crash
while
the
tests
are
running
.
One
way
to
do
this
is
with
the
[
crashme
add
-
on
]
(
https
:
/
/
github
.
com
/
luser
/
crashme
)
-
-
you
can
add
it
to
Firefox
even
while
the
tests
are
running
.
Another
way
on
Linux
and
Mac
OS
systems
:
1
.
Find
the
process
id
(
PID
)
of
the
Firefox
process
being
used
by
the
tests
.
sh
ps
x
|
grep
'
Firefox
'
2
.
Kill
the
Firefox
process
with
SIGABRT
.
sh
#

is
an
example
of
a
PID

in

produced
