The
DeleteMe
message
is
used
to
avoid
a
race
condition
between
the
parent
/
/
actor
and
the
child
actor
.
The
PBackgroundLSDatabase
protocol
could
be
/
/
simply
destroyed
by
sending
the
__delete__
message
from
the
child
side
.
/
/
However
that
would
destroy
the
child
actor
immediatelly
and
the
parent
/
/
could
be
sending
a
message
to
the
child
at
the
same
time
resulting
in
a
/
/
routing
error
since
the
child
actor
wouldn
'
t
exist
anymore
.
A
routing
/
/
error
typically
causes
a
crash
.
The
race
can
be
prevented
by
doing
the
/
/
teardown
in
two
steps
.
First
we
send
the
DeleteMe
message
to
the
parent
/
/
and
the
parent
then
sends
the
__delete__
message
to
the
child
.
