This
section
describes
the
process
for
adding
a
word
to
the
dictionary
:
#
.
Get
a
clone
of
mozilla
-
central
(
see
:
ref
:
Firefox
Contributors
'
Quick
Reference
)
if
you
don
t
already
have
one
and
make
sure
you
can
build
it
successfully
.
#
.
Get
into
the
dictionary
sources
directory
using
this
command
:
cd
extensions
/
spellcheck
/
locales
/
en
-
US
/
hunspell
/
dictionary
-
sources
#
.
There
s
a
special
script
used
for
editing
dictionaries
.
The
script
only
works
if
you
have
the
environment
variable
EDITOR
set
to
the
executable
of
an
editor
program
;
if
you
don
t
have
it
set
you
can
use
EDITOR
=
vim
sh
edit
-
dictionary
to
edit
using
vim
(
or
you
can
substitute
it
with
another
editor
)
or
you
can
just
type
sh
edit
-
dictionary
if
you
have
an
EDITOR
already
specified
.
#
.
Add
and
remove
words
in
the
dictionary
file
then
quit
the
editor
.
#
.
Build
Firefox
and
test
your
updated
dictionary
.
Once
you
re
satisfied
use
the
process
described
in
:
ref
:
write_a_patch
to
create
a
patch
.
Note
that
the
update
script
will
modify
2
files
and
both
need
to
be
committed
:
*

The
English
dictionary
available
in
mozilla
-
central
is
based
on
the
SCOWL
_
dictionary
.
Some
scripts
distributed
with
the
SCOWL
package
are
used
to
generate
the
files
for
the
en
-
US
dictionary
.
The
working
directory
for
this
process
is
extensions
/
spellcheck
/
locales
/
en
-
US
/
hunspell
/
dictionary
-
sources
.
#
.
Download
the
latest
version
of
the
dictionary
from
SCOWL
_
homepage
or
SourceForce
_
as
a
tarball
(
tag
.
gz
)
and
unpack
it
in
the
working
directory
.
Rename
the
resulting
folder
from
scowl
-
YYYY
.
MM
.
DD
to
scowl
.
#
.
Run
the
script
sh
make
-
new
-
dict
to
generate
a
new
dictionary
and
make
sure
it
runs
without
any
errors
.
For
more
details
on
this
script
see
the
make
-
new
-
dict
_
section
.
#
.
Do
a
sanity
check
on
the
resulting
dictionary
file
en_US
-
mozilla
.
dic
.
For
example
make
sure
that
the
size
is
about
the
same
as
the
original
dictionary
(
or
slightly
larger
)
.
#
.
If
everything
looks
correct
use
sh
install
-
new
-
dict
to
copy
the
generated
file
in
the
right
position
and
use
the
process
described
in

to
