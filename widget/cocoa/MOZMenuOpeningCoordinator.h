MOZMenuOpeningCoordinator
is
a
workaround
for
the
fact
that
opening
an
NSMenu
creates
a
nested
*
event
loop
.
This
event
loop
is
only
exited
after
the
menu
is
closed
.
The
caller
of
*
NativeMenuMac
:
:
ShowAsContextMenu
does
not
expect
ShowAsContextMenu
to
create
a
nested
event
loop
*
so
we
need
to
make
sure
to
open
the
NSMenu
asynchronously
.
*
/
interface
MOZMenuOpeningCoordinator
:
NSObject
+
(
instancetype
)
sharedInstance
;
/
/
Queue
aMenu
for
opening
.
/
/
The
menu
will
open
from
a
new
event
loop
tick
so
that
its
nested
event
loop
does
not
block
the
/
/
caller
.
If
another
menu
'
s
nested
event
loop
is
currently
on
the
stack
we
wait
for
that
nested
/
/
event
loop
to
unwind
before
opening
aMenu
.
Returns
a
handle
that
can
be
passed
to
/
/
cancelAsynchronousOpening
:
.
Can
only
be
called
on
the
main
thread
