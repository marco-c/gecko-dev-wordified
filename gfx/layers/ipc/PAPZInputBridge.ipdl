This
protocol
is
used
to
send
input
events
from
the
UI
process
to
the
*
GPU
process
for
handling
by
APZ
.
There
is
one
instance
per
top
-
level
*
compositor
or
in
other
words
one
instance
per
concrete
APZCTreeManager
*
instance
.
The
child
side
lives
on
the
main
thread
in
the
UI
process
*
and
the
parent
side
lives
on
the
main
thread
in
the
GPU
process
.
If
there
*
is
no
GPU
process
then
this
protocol
is
not
instantiated
.
