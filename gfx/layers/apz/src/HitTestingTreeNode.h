This
class
represents
a
node
in
a
tree
that
is
used
by
the
APZCTreeManager
*
to
do
hit
testing
.
The
tree
is
roughly
a
copy
of
the
layer
tree
but
only
*
contains
nodes
for
layers
that
have
scrollable
metrics
.
There
will
be
*
exactly
one
node
per
{
layer
scrollable
metrics
}
pair
(
since
a
layer
may
have
*
multiple
scrollable
metrics
)
.
However
multiple
HitTestingTreeNode
instances
*
may
share
the
same
underlying
APZC
instance
if
the
layers
they
represent
*
share
the
same
scrollable
metrics
(
i
.
e
.
are
part
of
the
same
animated
*
geometry
root
)
.
If
this
happens
exactly
one
of
the
HitTestingTreeNode
*
instances
will
be
designated
as
the
"
primary
holder
"
of
the
APZC
.
When
*
this
primary
holder
is
destroyed
it
will
destroy
the
APZC
along
with
it
;
*
in
contrast
destroying
non
-
primary
-
holder
nodes
will
not
destroy
the
APZC
.
*
Code
should
not
make
assumptions
about
which
of
the
nodes
will
be
the
*
primary
holder
only
that
that
there
will
be
exactly
one
for
each
APZC
in
*
the
tree
.
*
*
The
reason
this
tree
exists
at
all
is
so
that
we
can
do
hit
-
testing
on
the
*
thread
that
we
receive
input
on
(
referred
to
the
as
the
controller
thread
in
*
APZ
terminology
)
which
may
be
different
from
the
compositor
thread
.
*
Accessing
the
compositor
layer
tree
can
only
be
done
on
the
compositor
*
thread
and
so
it
is
simpler
to
make
a
copy
of
the
hit
-
testing
related
*
properties
into
a
separate
tree
.

Let

}
be
the
{
layer

}
pair
that
this
node
*
corresponds
to
in
the
layer
tree
.
Then
mEventRegions
contains
the
union
*
of
the
event
regions
of
all
layers
in
L
'

subtree
excluding
those
layers

which
are

*
This
value
is
stored
in
L

s
LayerPixel
space
.
*
For
example
if
this
HitTestingTreeNode
maps
to
a
ContainerLayer
with
*
scrollable
metrics
and
which
has
two
PaintedLayer
children
the
event
*
regions
stored
here
will
be
the
union
of
the
three
event
regions
in
the
*
ContainerLayer
'
s
layer
pixel
space
.
This
means
the
event
regions
from
the
*
PaintedLayer
children
will
have
been
transformed
and
clipped
according
to
*
the
individual
properties
on
those
layers
but
the

event
*
regions
will
be
used
