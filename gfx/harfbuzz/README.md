Both
development
and
user
support
discussion
around
HarfBuzz
happens
on
[
github
]
[

]
as
well
.
The
API
that
comes
with
hb
.
h
will
not
change
incompatibly
.
Other
peripheral
headers
are
more
likely
to
go
through
minor
modifications
but
again
we
do
our
best
to
never
change
API
in
an
incompatible
way
.
We
will
never
break
the
ABI
.
The
API
and
ABI
are
stable
even
across
major
version
number
jumps
.
In
fact
current
HarfBuzz
is
API
/
ABI
compatible
all
the
way
back
to
the
0
.
9
.
x
series
.
If
one
day
we
need
to
break
the
API
/
ABI
that
would
be
called
a
new
a
library
.
As
such
we
bump
the
major
version
number
only
when
we
add
major
new
features
the
minor
version
when
there
is
new
API
and
the
micro
version
when
there
are
bug
fixes

Name
HarfBuzz
(
)
is
the
literal
Persian
translation
of
[
OpenType
]
[
1
]
transliterated
using
the
Latin
script
.
It
also
means
"
talkative
"
or
"
glib
"
(
also
a
nod
to
the
GNOME
project
where
HarfBuzz
originates
from
)
.
>
Background
:
Originally
there
was
this
font
format
called
TrueType
.
People
and
>
companies
started
calling
their
type
engines
all
things
ending
in
Type
:
>
FreeType
CoolType
ClearType
etc
.
And
then
came
OpenType
which
is
the
>
successor
of
TrueType
.
So
for
my
OpenType
implementation
I
decided
to
stick
>
with
the
concept
but
use
the
Persian
translation
.
Which
is
fitting
given
that
>
Persian
is
written
in
the
Arabic
script
and
OpenType
is
an
extension
of
>
TrueType
that
adds
support
for
complex
script
rendering
and
HarfBuzz
is
an
>
implementation
of
OpenType
complex
text
shaping
.
