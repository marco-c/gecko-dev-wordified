UPDATING
:
Note
that
gfx
/
harfbuzz
/
src
/
hb
-
version
.
h
is
not
present
in
the
upstream
Git
repository
.
It
is
created
at
build
time
by
the
harfbuzz
build
system
;
but
as
we
don
'
t
use
that
build
system
in
mozilla
it
is
necessary
to
refresh
this
file
when
updating
harfbuzz
and
check
it
into
the
mozilla
tree
.
The
normal
approach
to
updating
harfbuzz
therefore
is
to
pull
the
latest
HB
source
into
a
scratch
directory
and
do
a
local
build
;
then
copy
the
original
sources
AND
the
generated
header
mentioned
above
from
the
build
directory
into
the
mozilla
tree
.
If
the
collection
of
source
files
changes
manual
updates
to
moz
.
build
may
be
needed
as
we
don
'
t
use
the
upstream
makefiles
.
