UPDATING
:
Our
in
-
tree
copy
of
HarfBuzz
does
not
depend
on
any
generated
files
from
the
upstream
build
system
.
Therefore
it
should
be
sufficient
to
simply
overwrite
the
in
-
tree
files
one
the
updated
ones
from
upstream
to
perform
updates
.
To
simplify
this
the
in
-
tree
copy
can
be
updated
by
running
sh
update
.
sh
from
within
the
gfx
/
harfbuzz
directory
.
If
the
collection
of
source
files
changes
manual
updates
to
moz
.
build
may
be
needed
as
we
don
'
t
use
the
upstream
makefiles
.
