#
This
test
contains
a
radial
gradient
with
rounded
corners
.
#
The
primitive
is
large
enough
to
exercise
the
quad
nine
-
patch
#
code
path
.
#
The
primitive
has
a
negative
scale
applied
to
it
.
The
goal
#
of
this
test
is
to
check
that
the
fiddly
coordinate
space
#
handling
of
decomposed
quads
properly
handles
transforms
that
#
can
flip
primitives
.
