Step
1
:
Install
Rust
if
you
don
'
t
have
it
already
If
you
are
doing
gecko
builds
already
you
should
already
have
Rust
as
it
is
a
build
requirement
.
If
not
you
can
install
it
using
|
mach
bootstrap
|
(
recommended
)
or
from
https
:
/
/
www
.
rust
-
lang
.
org
/
Note
:
If
installing
manually
use
the
stable
64
-
bit
release
-
on
Windows
make
sure
to
use
the
MSVC
ABI
installer
.
Ensure
that
rustc
and
cargo
are
in
your
PATH
(
adding
HOME
/
.
cargo
/
bin
/
should
be
sufficient
)
Step
2
:
Set
up
mozconfig
Add
the
following
line
to
your
mozconfig
:
ac_add_options
-
-
enable
-
webrender
The
first
time
you
do
a
build
with
this
changes
you
should
also
run
|
mach
clobber
|
Step
3
:
Build
using
|
mach
build
|
When
making
changes
:
-
Make
the
changes
you
want
.
-
Run
|
mach
build
|
or
|
mach
build
binaries
|
as
desired
.
For
a
debug
webrender
build
:
Use
a
debug
mozconfig
(
ac_add_options
-
-
enable
-
debug
)
You
can
also
use
an
opt
build
but
make
webrender
less
optimized
by
putting
opt
-
level
=
0
in
the
[
profile
.
release
]
section
of
your
toolkit
/
library
/
rust
/
Cargo
.

What
if
you
have
to
make
changes
to
webrender
itself
?
1
)
Update
your
graphics
branch
checkout
to
the
latest
code
on
the
graphics
branch
2
)
Check
out
and
update
the
webrender
repo
to
the
version
you
want
3
)
Copy
over
the
webrender
and
webrender_traits
folders
into
gfx
/
.
The
best
way
to
do
this
is
to
simply
delete
the
gfx
/
webrender
and
gfx
/
webrender_traits
folders
and
use
|
cp
-
R
|
to
copy
them
in
again
from
the
webrender
repo
.
Update
the
"
latest
commit
"
information
at
the
bottom
of
this
file
with
the
version
.
4
)
If
you
need
to
modify
webrender_bindings
/
Cargo
.
toml
to
include
or
remove
features
do
so
now
.
4
)
Commit
your
changes
to
the
graphics
branch
locally
5
)
Go
into
toolkit
/
library
/
rust
and
run
|
cargo
update
-
-
aggressive
-
p
webrender
|
.
Do
the
same
in
toolkit
/
library
/
gtest
/
rust
.
This
will
update
the
corresponding
Cargo
.
lock
files
with
the
latest
webrender
dependencies
.
Note
that
this
will
update
all
webrender
dependencies
to
their
latest
allowed
versions
.
In
particular
the
latest
allowed
minor
version
will
be
used
(
this
in
theory
should
always
be
safe
but
may
not
be
so
)
.
If
you
need
to
force
a
particular
dependency
to
a
particular
version
you
can
run
|
cargo
update
-
p
<
package
>
-
-
precise
<
version
>
|
.
Make
sure
to
do
this
in
both
toolkit
/
library
/
rust
/
and
toolkit
/
library
/
gtest
/
rust
/
.
6
)
Run
|
mach
vendor
rust
|
to
update
the
rust
dependencies
in
third_party
/
rust
7
)
Commit
the
vendored
changes
locally
8
)
Build
and
test
.
You
may
need
to
make
changes
in
bindings
.
rs
or
on
the
C
+
+
side
depending
on
what
changed
in
webrender
.
This
can
potentially
be
quite
tricky
if
you
don
'
t
fully
understand
the
API
changes
on
the
webrender
side
.
In
this
step
try
to
not
use
your
new
features
yet
just
get
the
build
working
with
the
minimal
changes
.
9
)
Commit
the
changes
locally
from
step
7
and
push
everything
to
the
graphics
branch
.
10
)
Now
you
have
an
update
webrender
with
the
new
features
you
wanted
so
you
can
write
gecko
code
against
them
.
Yes
this
is
somewhat
painful
.
It
used
to
be
worse
.
