Service
for
blocking
application
startup
to
be
used
on
the
first
install
.
The
intended
*
use
case
is
for
FirstStartup
to
be
invoked
when
the
application
is
called
by
an
installer
*
such
as
the
Windows
Stub
Installer
to
allow
the
application
to
do
some
first
-
install
tasks
*
such
as
performance
tuning
and
downloading
critical
data
.
*
*
In
this
scenario
the
installer
does
not
exit
until
the
first
application
window
appears
*
which
gives
the
user
experience
of
the
application
starting
up
quickly
on
first
install
.

and
spin
the
event
loop
until
either
all
required
services
have
*
completed
or
until
a
timeout
is
reached
.
