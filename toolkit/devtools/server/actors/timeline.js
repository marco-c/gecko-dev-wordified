Many
Gecko
operations
(
painting
reflows
restyle
.
.
.
)
can
be
tracked
*
in
real
time
.
A
marker
is
a
representation
of
one
operation
.
A
marker
*
has
a
name
and
start
and
end
timestamps
.
Markers
are
stored
in
docShells
.
*
*
This
actor
exposes
this
tracking
mechanism
to
the
devtools
protocol
.
*
*
To
start
/
stop
recording
markers
:
*
TimelineFront
.
start
(
)
*
TimelineFront
.
stop
(
)
*
TimelineFront
.
isRecording
(
)
*
*
When
markers
are
available
an
event
is
emitted
:
*
TimelineFront
.
on
(
"
markers
"
function
(
markers
)
{

in

have

a

Get
the
list
of
docShells
in
the
currently
attached
tabActor
.
Note
that
we
*
always
list
the
docShells
included
in
the
real
root
docShell
even
if
the
*
tabActor
was
switched
to
a
child
frame
.
This
is
because
for
now
paint
*
markers
are
only
recorded
at
parent
frame
level
so
switching
the
timeline
*
to
a
child
frame
would
hide
all
paint
markers
.
