AI
Models
are
optional
components
that
get
added
to
{
-
brand
-
short
-
name
}
when
they
are
first
needed
by
a
feature
or
extension
you
use
.
They
process
your
queries
on
your
device
meaning
they
are
more
private
than
online
AI
providers
but
sometimes
slower
depending
on
the
performance
of
your
device
