#
Profiles
Service
Gecko
based
applications
store
almost
all
of
their
persistent
data
inside
a
profile
.
This
is
true
on
both
Android
and
Desktop
.
Many
instances
of
the
same
Gecko
application
can
run
at
the
same
time
as
long
as
they
use
different
profiles
.
Profiles
are
locked
using
OS
file
locking
mechanisms
when
in
use
attempting
to
start
a
second
instance
of
an
application
with
the
same
profile
will
fail
with
a
profile
in
use
error
.
This
documentation
covers
the
basic
architecture
of
the
profiles
service
.
There
is
also
specific
documentation
on
[
changes
made
to
the
service
]
(

)
.
Two
layered
services
are
responsible
for
maintaining
the
set
of
known
profiles
that
can
be
selected
by
users
through
a
user
interface
and
choosing
a
default
profile
at
startup
.
It
is
also
possible
to
select
profile
directories
unknown
to
these
services
through
various
mechanisms
which
is
common
for
development
and
automated
testing
scenarios
.
The
first
layer
uses
the
[
Toolkit
Profile
Service
]
(
#
toolkit
-
profile
-
service
)
which
maintains
a
list
of
nsIToolkitProfiles
.
This
is
called
at
startup
and
it
selects
the
profile
directories
to
use
for
this
instance
of
the
application
.
The
second
layer
is
the
[
Selectable
Profile
Service
]
(
#
selectable
-
profile
-
service
)
.
This
service
is
only
used
on
Desktop
.
When
in
use
the
nsIToolkitProfile
managed
by
the
Toolkit
Profile
Service
can
be
thought
of
as
a
profile
group
and
the
Selectable
Profile
Service
allows
for
managing
and
switching
between
profiles
within
that
group
.
#
#
Profile
Directories
A
profile
is
made
up
of
one
or
two
directories
.
When
made
up
of
two
directories
one
directory
is
used
for
persistent
data
while
the
second
is
used
for
caches
that
can
safely
be
deleted
.
When
just
one
directory
is
used
the
persistent
data
and
caches
are
colocated
.
These
directories
are
commonly
referred
to
as
the
profile
root
directory
and
the
profile
local
directory
(
because
in
Windows
enterprise
environments
the
caches
will
be
kept
local
to
the
computer
while
the
persistent
data
may
be
stored
in
a
directory
that
is
copied
across
different
computers
)
.
Whenever
a
Gecko
application
is
running
it
is
possible
to
get
the
root
directory
via
the
ProfD
key
of
the
directory
service
and
the
local
directory
via
the
ProfLD
key
.
In
the
case
that
only
one
directory
is
in
use
these
will
be
identical
values
.
For
the
most
part
components
interested
in
storing
their
data
should
use
these
methods
to
get
the
profile
directories
and
should
not
attempt
to
use
the
profile
services
.
Whether
two
directories
or
just
one
are
used
depends
on
the
location
of
the
root
directory
in
the
filesystem
.
If
it
is
in
the
default
location
for
profiles
which
is
the
OS
standard
location
for
user
settings
then
a
second
directory
is
used
and
is
in
the
OS
standard
location
for
user
caches
.
Both
profile
directories
will
have
the
same
leaf
name
.
The
default
locations
for
profile
root
directories
are
:
*
Windows
:

Profile
storeID
Every
profile
is
assigned
a
storeID
which
is
a
short
alphanumeric
string
.
When
the
Selectable
Profile
Service
is
in
use
the
same
storeID
is
shared
by
all
profiles
in
the
same
group
.
In
all
other
cases
the
storeID
is
unique
to
every
profile
.
This
identifier
is
used
as
the
mechanism
for
grouping
profiles

as

manages
a
unique
SQLite
database
for
each
storeID
.
This
means
that
when
there
are
a
group
of
profiles
using
the
same
storeID
then
they
all
use
the
same
SQLite
database
allowing
for
persisting
data
that
can
be
used
by
every
profile
in
the
group
.
It
provides
direct
access
to
a
SQLite
connection
and
a
mechanism
for
notifying
running
instances
that
are
using
the
same
database
.
This
storeID
is
used
to
construct
a
filename
for
the
database
file
.
For
development
and
temporary
profiles
with
no
associated
nsIToolkitProfile
the
database
is
stored
in
the
profile
root
directory
.
Otherwise
this
file
is
stored
in
a
directory
shared
by
all
profiles
.
The
database
is
created
the
first
time
a
component
requests
a
connection
to
it
.

The
service
may
also
be
configured

window
optionally
shown

the

In
the
case
that
the
Selectable

is
in
use
the
nsIToolkitProfile
should
be
thought
of
as
representing
a
group

the

represents
the
current

for

#
#
Selectable
Profile
Service
The
Selectable
Profile
Service
manages
a
list
of

in
the
Profiles
Datastore
Service
.
These
profiles
all
share
a
storeID
and
are
linked
by
a
single
nsIToolkitProfile
.
When
new
profiles
are
created
this
service
is
responsible
for
initializing
the
new
profile
with
the
same
storeID
so
that
relevant
data
is
shared
across
all
profiles
in
the
group
.
The
storeID
is
stored
in
the
nsIToolkitProfile
section
in

and
the
Path
property
is
used
to
represent
the
most
recently
used
profile
in

This
will
be
changed
frequently
as
the

switches
