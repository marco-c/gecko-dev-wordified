profiles
.
ini
Prior
to
Gecko
67
the
Toolkit
Profile
Service
loaded
data
from
profiles
.
ini
into
a
custom
in
-
memory
structure
and
then
manually
serialized
that
data
back
to
profiles
.
ini
when
needed
.
This
meant
that
any
unknown
data
in
profiles
.
ini
would
be
ignored
when
read
and
then
lost
when
the
data
was
serialized
.
Since
profiles
.
ini
must
be
readable
and
writable
by
any
version
of
Gecko
that
a
user
might
be
expected
to
have
installed
this
makes
it
very
challenging
to
evolve
the
schema
of
profiles
.
ini
.
In
Gecko
67
this
was
changed
to
load
the
full
INI
data
into
memory
modify
that
when
changes
were
made
and
then
serialize
the
entire
INI
data
back
to
disk
so
any
unknown
data
was
not
lost
.
In
order
to
detect
whether
data
might
have
been
lost
due
to
the
use
of
an
older
version
of
the
application
a
new
Version
property
was
added
to
the
INI
file
initially
set
to
2
.
The
absence
of
this
property
indicates
that
a
destructive
write
to
profiles
.
ini
has
taken
place
.
This
is
still
not
perfect
the
data
is
read
only
once
during
startup
and
then
serialized
whenever
needed
but
if
multiple
Gecko
processes
are
running
then
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
clobber
each
others
changes
.
To
protect
against
this
when
the
INI
file
is
read
the
process
captures
its
last
modification
time
and
size
.
If
data
needs
to
be
changed
then
the
process
checks
that
the
INI
file
on
disk
still
has
the
same
properties
and
if
so
refuses
to
overwrite
the
file
.
This
avoids
clobbering
another
process
'
s
data
at
the
risk
that
the
current
process
'
s
changes
cannot
be
written
to
disk
.
The
various
profile
management
interfaces
were
made
to
check
that
writing
is
possible
before
allowing
the
user
to
make
modifications
however
there
are
still
time
windows
where
this
problem
occurs
.
Since
the
number
of
users
using
profile
management
was
low
this
edge
case
was
considered
not
worth
solving
.
#
#
Profile
per
install
Prior
to
Gecko
67
the
Toolkit
Profile
Service
only
supported
one
default
profile
for
the
entire
OS
user
.
This
meant
that
different
installs
of
an
application
such
as
Release
and
Beta
would
use
the
same
default
profile
.
This
was
marked
in
the
profile
section
in
profiles
.
ini
with
the
Default
=
1
flag
.
This
behaviour
was
undesirable
with
the
introduction
of
profile
downgrade
protection
which
blocked
using
a
profile
if
it
had
most
recently
been
used
with
a
newer
version
of
the
application
.
In
order
to
solve
this
new
[
InstallXXXXXXX
]
sections
were
added
to
profiles
.
ini
.
Each
section
used
a
hash
of
the
application
installation
directory
to
store
per
-
install
data
.
The
data
included
the
current
default
profile
for
the
install
using
the
profile
relative
path
as
the
identifier
because
the
profile
section
numbers
are
not
stable
.
It
also
included
a
Locked
flag
used
as
part
of
the
migration
process
.
To
protect
against
loss
of
data
in
the
event
that
the
user
made
use
of
an
application
based
on
a
version
of
Gecko
prior
to
67
the
install
sections
would
also
be
backed
up
to
an
installs
.
ini
file
.
When
a
destructive
modification
is
detected
(
by
the
absence
of
the
profiles
.
ini
Version
property
)
this
data
is
re
-
inserted
into
profiles
.
ini
.
Migrating
to
profile
per
install
happened
at
startup
for
each
install
that
did
not
already
have
an
install
section
present
in
profiles
.
ini
and
either
no
specific
profile
was
selected
on
the
command
line
or
via
the
profile
manager
UI
or
if
a
profile
was
chosen
via
an
environment
variable
(
normally
used
when
the
application
has
restarted
to
apply
an
update
)
.
The
goals
of
migration
were
:
*
For
a
user
with
only
a
single
install
of
the
application
continue
using
the
old
default
profile
.
*
For
a
user
with
multiple
installs
only
one
of
them
should
select
the
old
default
profile
as
its
new
default
other
installs
should
have
new
profiles
created
.
*
In
this
case
prefer
to
assign
the
old
default
to
whichever
install
is
the
default
browser
for
the
operating
system
.
For
each
install
on
first
startup
after
the
feature
was
enabled
the
old
default
profile
would
be
inspected
:
1
.
If
the
profile
was
last
run
by
a
different
install
(
by
looking
at
its
compatibility
.
ini
file
)
then
it
would
be
ignored
.
2
.
If
the
profile
had
already
been
*
locked
*
by
a
different
install
then
it
would
be
ignored
.
3
.
Otherwise
the
profile
will
be
marked
as
default
for
this
install
but
not
locked
the
profile
will
also
be
removed
as
default
from
any
other
installs
.
The
profile
is
also
unmarked
as
the
old
default
.
4
.
If
the
old
default
was
ignored
then
a
new
profile
is
created
and
locked
to
the
current
install
.
5
.
If
the
old
default
was
selected
and
the
current
install
is
the
default
browser
then
the
profile
is
locked
to
this
install
.
For
technical
reasons
this
has
to
happen
later
in
startup
.
Note
that
since
a
claimed
profile
is
unmarked
as
the
old
default
this
selection
process
happens
for
the
first
application
instance
and
then
only
for
subsequent
instances
that
are
restarted
via
application
update
.
In
order
to
maintain
compatibility
with
older
versions
of
the
application
an
empty
profile
is
created
and
marked
as
the
old
-
style
default
profile
.
Any
future
uses
of
older
version
will
use
this
profile
instead
of
downgrading
the
other
profiles
.
#
#
New
profiles
UI
profile
groups
and
shared
data
In
Gecko
138
a
new
profiles
experience
was
implemented
with
more
user
friendly
experience
.
Early
on
in
the
development
process
the
decision
was
made
to
implement
this
as
a
mostly
separate
service
with
separate
storage
layered
on
top
of
the
old
[
Toolkit
Profile
Service
]
(
.
/
index
.
md
#
toolkit
-
profile
-
service
)
.
There
were
many
reasons
for
this
choice
:
*
The
new
feature
was
to
be
rolled
out
slowly
to
existing
users
so
it
was
desirable
to
make
minimal
changes
to
the
existing
service
that
might
cause
bugs
for
users
not
yet
included
in
the
rollout
.
*
New
profiles
were
to
have
richer
metadata
including
avatars
and
themes
than
was
currently
available
.
Attempting
to
store
these
in
profiles
.
ini
would
cause
issues
if
users
[
used
older
versions
]
(
#
consistent
-
profiles
-
ini
)
and
telemetry
showed
that
an
unnerving
number
of
users
still
do
.
*
The
new
UI
also
needed
to
be
able
to
display
up
to
date
information
about
all
profiles
and
allow
for
concurrent
modification
by
multiple
running
instances
.
The
existing
profiles
.
ini
file
is
not
suitable
for
this
purpose
.
*
Many
users
already
have
multiple
profiles
without
necessarily
realising
it
.
Different
installs
will
create
different
default
profiles
profile
reset
sometimes
leaves
behind
old
profiles
.
Exposing
these
in
the
new
interface
would
be
confusing
.
*
Some
users
use
different
profiles
for
privacy
related
reasons
.
Exposing
these
in
the
interface
could
inadvertently
expose
sensitive
information
.
*
It
was
desirable
to
still
provide
a
way
for
QA
and
developers
to
switch
between
entirely
clean
setups
of
the
application
.
The
main
changes
to
the
older
Toolkit
Profile
Service
were
:
*
Adding
a
StoreID
property
to
profile
sections
to
allow
selecting
the
profile
group
.
*
Detecting
the
selected
nsIToolkitProfile
based
on
the
storeID
of
the
currently
running
profile
.
*
Adding
a
new
method
to
update
just
the
current
nsIToolkitProfile
'
s
section
in
profiles
.
ini
without
clobbering
another
application
'
s
changes
to
the
rest
of
the
file
.
