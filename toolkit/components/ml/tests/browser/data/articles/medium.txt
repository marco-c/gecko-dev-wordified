What
lies
beneath
the
Great
Lakes
'
waves
is
largely
unknown
but
there
'
s
a
new
push
to
learn
more
about
thousands
of
shipwrecks
underwater
infrastructure
and
the
impacts
of
climate
change
on
the
bottom
of
the
world
'
s
largest
freshwater
system
.
Only
15
per

to
secure
funding
to
map
the
entire
lakebed
in
high

resolution
.
Advocates
argue
the
effort
would
paint
a
detailed
picture
of
shipwrecks
infrastructure
such
as
pipelines
and
topography
that
would
inform
storm
surge
models
as
the
climate
warms
.
Jennifer
Boehme
grew
up
scouting
beaches
around
her
home
in
St
.
Petersburg
Fla
.
for
whatever
she
could
find
.
Rocks
sand
dollars
coquina
mollusks
anything
the
ocean
gave
up
.
Now
40
years
later
Boehme
wants
to
launch
another
treasure
hunt
.

The
4
factors
that
have
led
to
a
'
golden
age
'
of
discovery
for
Great
Lakes
shipwrecks
How
will
Lake
Huron
'
s
shoreline
look
in
100
years
?
Here
'
s
the
map
The
map
she
says
also
will
help
ships
avoid
submerged
hazards
identify
fisheries
and
inform
erosion
storm
surge
and
flooding
models
as
climate
change
intensifies
.
One
of
the
things
that
keeps
me
going
is
the
idea
of
the
discovery
aspect
of
it
Boehme
said
.
There
'
s
a
lot
we
don
'
t
know
about
the
lakes
.
We
know
more
about
the
surface
of
the
moon
.
