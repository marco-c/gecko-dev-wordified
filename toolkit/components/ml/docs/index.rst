This
component
is
an
experimental
machine
learning
local
inference
engine
based
on
Transformers
.
js
and
the
ONNX
runtime
.
In
the
example
below
an
image
is
converted
to
text
using
the
image
-
to
-
text
task
.
.
.
code
-
block
:
:
javascript
const
{
PipelineOptions
EngineProcess
}
=
ChromeUtils
.
importESModule
(
"
chrome
:
/
/
global
/
content
/
ml
/
EngineProcess
.
sys
.
mjs
"
)
;
/
/
First
we
create
a
pipeline
options
object
which
contains
the
task
name
/
/
and
any
other
options
needed
for
the
task
const
options
=
new
PipelineOptions
(
{
taskName
:
"
image
-
to
-
text
"
}
)
;
/
/
Next
we
create
an
engine
parent
object
via
EngineProcess
const
engineParent
=
await
EngineProcess
.
getMLEngineParent
(
)
;
/
/
We
then
create
the
engine
object
using
the
options
const
engine
=
engineParent
.
getEngine
(
options
)
;
/
/
At
this
point
we
are
ready
to
do
some
inference
.
/
/
We
need
to
get
the
image
as
an
array
buffer
and
wrap
it
into
a
request
object
const
response
=
await
fetch
(
"
https
:
/
/
huggingface
.
co
/
datasets
/
mishig
/
sample_images
/
resolve
/
main
/

-
match
.
jpg
"
)
;
const
buffer
=
await
response
.
arrayBuffer
(
)
;
const
mimeType
=
response
.
headers
.
get
(
'
Content
-
Type
'
)
;
const
request
=
{
data
:
buffer
mimeType
:
mimeType
}
;
/
/
Finally
we
run
the
engine
with
the
request
object
const
res
=
await
engine
.
run
(
request
)
;
/
/
The
result
is
a
string
containing
the
text
extracted
from
the
image
console
.
log
(
res
)
