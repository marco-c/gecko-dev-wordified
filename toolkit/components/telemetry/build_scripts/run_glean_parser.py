#
Unlike
most
vendored
packages
we
don
'
t
want
"
glean_parser
"
in
    
#
"
build
/
virtualenv_packages
.
txt
"
because
it
interferes
with
mach
'
s
usage
of
Glean
.
    
#
This
is
because
Glean
(
"
glean_sdk
"
)
:
    
#
*
Has
native
code
(
so
can
'
t
be
vendored
)
    
#
*
Also
depends
on
"
glean_parser
"
    
#
Since
this
file
has
different
version
constraints
than
mach
on
"
glean_parser
"
    
#
we
want
the
two
different
consumers
to
own
their
own
separate
"
glean_parser
"
    
#
packages
.
    
#
    
#
This
is
solved
by
:
    
#
*
Having
mach
import
Glean
(
and
transitively
"
glean_parser
"
)
via
the
"
-
-
user
"
    
#
package
environment
.
To
accomplish
this
the
vendored
"
glean_parser
"
is
removed
    
#
from
"
virtualenv_packages
.
txt
"
.
    
#
*
Having
this
script
import
"
glean_parser
"
from
the
vendored
location
.

is
