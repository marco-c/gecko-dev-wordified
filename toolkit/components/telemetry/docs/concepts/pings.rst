A
*
Telemetry
ping
*
is
the
data
that
we
send
to
Mozillas
Telemetry
servers
.
That
data
is
stored
as
a
JSON
object
client
-
side
and
contains
common
information
to
all
pings
and
a
payload
specific
to
a
certain
*
ping
types
*
.
The
top
-
level
structure
is
defined
by
the
:
doc

It
contains
some
basic
information

The
server

side
behaviour
is
documented
in
the
HTTP
Edge

specification

Pings
are
submitted
via
a
common
API
on
TelemetryController
.
If
a
ping
fails
to
successfully
submit
to
the
server
immediately
(
e
.
g
.
because
of
missing
internet
connection
)
Telemetry
will
store
it
on
disk
and
retry
to
send
it
until
the
maximum
ping
age
is
exceeded
(
14
days
)
.
*
Note
:
*
the
:
doc
:
main
pings
<
.
.
/
data
/
main
-
ping
>
are
kept
locally
even
after
successful
submission
to
enable
the
HealthReport
and
SelfSupport
features
.
They
will
be
deleted
after
their
retention
period
of
180
days
.
Sending
of
pending
pings
starts
as
soon
as
the
delayed
startup
is
finished
.
They
are
sent
in
batches
newest
-
first
with
up
to
10
persisted
pings
per
batch
plus
all
unpersisted
pings
.
The
send
logic
then
waits
for
each
batch
to
complete
.
If
it
succeeds
we
trigger
the
next
send
of
a
ping
batch
.
This
is
delayed
as
needed
to
only
trigger
one
batch
send
per
minute
.
If
ping
sending
encounters
an
error
that
means
retrying
later
a
backoff
timeout
behavior
is
triggered
exponentially
increasing
the
timeout
for
the
next
try
from
1
minute
up
to
a
limit
of
120
minutes
.
Any
new
ping
submissions
and
"
idle
-
daily
"
events
reset
this
behavior
as
a
safety
mechanism
and
trigger
immediate
ping
sending
.

team

We
send

different
ping
types

the
ping

contains
the

of
the
Telemetry

For
more
specific
use

cases
we
also
send
other
custom

types
.
