We
define
them
here
rather
than
let
them
be
imported
directly
as
they
haven
'

been
updated
to
work
fully
with

yet

We
use
Extension
from
the
extensions
code
but
importing
that
requires
/
/
a
lot
of
set
-
up
and
so
we
skip
it
for
now
.
type
Extension
=
any

The
WebExtensionPolicy
that
is
returned
from
WebExtensionPolicy
.
getByID
(
)
/
/
has
a
slightly
different
interface
to
how
the
webidl
defines
it
so
we
define
/
/
that
here
.
interface
WebExtensionPolicy

extension
