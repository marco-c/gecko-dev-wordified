Test
migration
of
application
provided
search
engines
that
*
are
being
renamed
(
bug
1899574
)
.
*
*
Prior
to
the
settings
file
version
7
we
used
to
index
search
*
engines
by
name
.
For
version
7
or
later
we
now
index
by
the
engine
*
identifier
.
*
*
We
are
renaming
some
of
the
Wikipedia
engines
to
match
their
search
pages
.
*
For
those
users
already
on
v7
or
later
the
name
change
won
'
t
matter
as
we
*
index
by
identifier
.
*
For
users
on
a
version
before
v7
we
must
ensure
that
we
migrate
the
engine
*
settings
correctly
.

The

the

here
is
that

this
