Certain
classes
(
Document
at
time
of
writing
)
have
a
cached
value
for
*
ShouldResistFingerprinting
.
By
adding
a
Target
check
into
their
ShouldRFP
*
function
we
are
potentially
changing
the
return
value
of
what
was
*
previously
the
cached
value
.
This
is
intentional
in
most
places
but
not
*
in
any
place
that
is
asking
if
e
.
g
.
restyling
needs
to
occur
.
Use
this
enum
*
value
for
that
in
conjunction
with
a
check
in
the
affected
class
.

a

(
This
saves
us
more
computation
and
casting
later

This

will
still
need

to
check
whether
an
individual

is
allowed

the
initial
question
of

"
Does
this
document
have
any
RFP
applied
to
it
ever
?
"
can
still
be
precomputed
.
*
This
enum
value
will
always
be
included
in
RFPLite
so
when
a
document
asks
if
they
*
might
have
RFP
enabled
it
will
return
true
