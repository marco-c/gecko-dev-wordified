Etymology
of
Mochitests
"
'
It
\
'
s
interesting
that
inside
of
Mozilla
most
people
call
mochitests
"
mohkee
tests
"
.
I
believe
this
is
because
it
is
'
'
adjacent
to
the
term
"
mocha
tests
"
which
is
pronounced
with
the
hard
k
sound
.
However
thetesting
'
'
infrastructure
is
named
after
the
delicious
Japanese
treat
knownas
mochi
.
Mochi
pronounced
like
"
moh
'
'
chee
"
is
a
food
that
is
made
frompounding
steamed
rice
into
a
soft
elastic
mass
