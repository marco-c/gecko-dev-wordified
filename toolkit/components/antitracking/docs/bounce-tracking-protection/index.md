Bounce
Tracking
Protection
Bounce
Tracking
Protection
(
BTP
)
is
an
anti
-
tracking
feature
in
Gecko
which
detects
bounce
trackers
(
navigational
tracking
)
based
on
a
set
of
heuristics
.
As
opposed
to
the
[
cookie
purging
]
(
.
.
/
cookie
-
purging
/
index
.
md
)
feature
it
does
not
rely
on
a
list
of
trackers
which
makes
it
more
webcompat
friendly
while
also
covering
unknown
bounce
trackers
.
#
#
Standardization
The
protection
is
a
work
item
of
the
PrivacyCG
.
The
implementation
in
Gecko
closely
follows
the
[
Bounce
Tracking
Mitigations
spec
draft
]
(
https
:
/
/
privacycg
.
github
.
io
/
nav
-
tracking
-
mitigations
/
#
bounce
-
tracking
-
mitigations
)
.
Mozilla
also
has
a
[
specification
position
on
Bounce
Tracking
Mitigations
]
(

.
#
#
Behavior
BTP
detects
bounce
trackers
by
looking
at
navigation
timing
.
It
establishes
the
concept
of
an
extended
navigation
which
can
encompass
a
chain
of
short
-
lived
redirects
.
These
short
-
lived
redirects
are
commonly
used
by
bounce
trackers
.
If
a
site
accesses
cookies
or
storage
in
such
a
short
-
lived
redirect
it
gets
added
to
a
classification
list
.
Classified
bounce
trackers
have
their
cookies
site
data
and
cache
purged
periodically
.
In
order
to
avoid
false
positives
and
purging
data
that
may
be
important
for
users
sites
which
the
user
directly
interacted
with
in
the
last
45
days
are
exempt
from
being
classified
or
purged
.

This

behavior

Logging
BTP
has
a
logger
which
can
be
enabled
by
starting
Firefox
with
the
MOZ_LOG
environment
variable
.
Use
MOZ_LOG
=
BounceTrackingProtection
:
5
for
verbose
logging
for
every
navigation
and
MOZ_LOG
=
BounceTrackingProtection
:
3
for
more
concise
logging
focused
on
classification
and
purging
.
#
#
Testing
When
testing
sites
to
ensure
they
don
'
t
get
purged
for
bounce
tracking
behavior
you
can
use
both
logging
(
as
described
above
)
to
observe
classification
and
direct
calls
to
the
feature
via
the
Browser
Toolbox
to
trigger
the
purging
early
.
You
can
also
check
the
developer
tools
console
for
warning
messages
which
will
be
logged
when
a
site
gets
classified
.
Example
:
>
bounce
-
tracking
-
demo
-
tracker
-
server
.
glitch
.
me
has
been
classified
as
a
>
bounce
tracker
.
If
it
does
not
receive
user
activation
within
the
next
3
600
>
seconds
it
will
have
its
state
purged
.
The
snippets
in
the
following
section
need
to
be
executed
in
the
[
Browser
Toolbox
]
.
Note
that
while
the
toolbox
looks
like
the
regular
devtools
it
'
s
a
special
console
used
to
debug
Firefox
itself
rather
than
websites

you
need

documentation

Sites
which
have
been
purged
or
which
receive
user
interaction
are
automatically
removed
from
this
list
.
Note
that
just
because
a
site
is
in
this
list
it
doesn
'
t
mean
that
it
gets
classified
.
Once
classified
there
is
a
grace
period
of
1h
in
which
the
site
may
receive
user
interaction
.
If
the
user
interacts
with
the
site
in
that
time
window
it
is
removed
from
the
bounce
tracker
list
and
exempt
from
purging
for
45
days
.
#
#
#
Trigger
a
purge
of
all
classified
trackers
:
Before
navigating
to
the
site
set
privacy
.
bounceTrackingProtection
.
bounceTrackingGracePeriodSec
to
0
or
a
low
number
.
This
controls
how
fast
after
(
classified
)
bounce
a
site
may
be
purged
.
If
you
don
'
t
update
this
pref
you
need
to
wait
up
to
1h
for
a
site
to
be
purged
.
Purges
normally
run
every
hour
.
To
trigger
a
purge
manually
you
can
use
the
following
snippet
:
javascript
await
Cc
[
"
mozilla
.
org
/
bounce
-

-
protection
;

"
]
.
getService
(
Ci
.
nsIBounceTrackingProtection
)
.
testRunPurgeBounceTrackers
(
)
;
The
return
value
will
be
an
array
of
sites
that
have
been
purged
.
Note
that
purging
applies
for
the
entire
domain
(
eTLD
+
1
)
