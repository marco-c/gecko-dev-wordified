SmartBlock
Embeds
SmartBlock
Embeds
is
an
anti
-
tracking
feature
that
allows
the
user
to
opt
-
in
to
viewing
supported
embeds
by
unblocking
their
corresponding
scripts
.
These
scripts
are
frequently
blocked
in
modes
with
higher
tracking
protections
like
ETP
Strict
because
they
often
track
the
user
across
sites
but
are
also
necessary
for
the
embeds
to
load
properly
.
Allowing
the
user
to
opt
-
in
to
viewing
these
embeds
lets
users
access
more
functionality
in
higher
protection
modes
and
allows
them
to
stay
in
these
modes
for
longer
.
Though
opting
in
technically
reduces
privacy
protections
the
alternative
would
be
to
switch
to
a
lower
protection
mode
thus
sacrificing
a
larger
amount
of
privacy
protections
.

How
does
it
work
?
SmartBlock
Embeds
relies
on
and
extends
the
existing
Smartblock
shim
infrastructure
from
the
Webcompat
extension
.
On
a
high
level
there
are
two
parts
to
Smartblock
Embeds
:
the
shims
and
the
protections
panel
toggles
.
The
shim
replaces
the
script
that
is
reponsible
for
loading
the
content
of
the
embed
.
Instead
of
loading
the
embed
like
the
original
script
would
the
shim
replaces
the
embed
with
a
placeholder
.
The
placeholder
includes
a
button
that
directs
the
user
to
the
protections
panel
.
!
[

)
In
the
protections
panel
we
include
a
toggle
for
each
type
of
embed
that
got
replaced
.
If
/
when
the
user
clicks
the
toggle
in
the
protections
panel
to
unblock
the
request
the
shim
will
put
the
original
embeds
back
and
load
the
tracker
script
which
will
subsequently
load
the
embeds
like
normal
.

Below
is
a
more
detailed
step
by
step
overview
of
how
SmartBlock
Embeds
blocks
and
unblocks
embeds
.
1
.
Website
sends
the
network
request
for
an
embed
'
s
script
2
.
Request
for
the
embed
'
s
script
is
intercepted
by
the
Webcompat
extension
and
extension
replaces
the
script
with
the
SmartBlock
Embed
shim
3
.
SmartBlock
Embed
shim
replaces
all
embeds
on
the
page
with
placeholders
4
.
User
clicks
the
button
on
the
placeholder
which
opens
the
protections
panel
through
the
Webcompat
extension
'
s
privileged
API
5
.
User
sets
the
toggle
to
on
in
the
protections
panel
which
sends
an
'
unblock
'
message
to
the
shim
through
the
privileged
API
6
.
Shim
recieves
the
message
and
replaces
the
placeholders
with
the
original
embeds
7
.
Shim
loads
the
embed
script
which
populates
the
embedded
content
8
.
User
opens
protections
panel
and
sets
the
toggle
to
off
which
triggers
a
page
reload
and
the
process
starts
over
again
