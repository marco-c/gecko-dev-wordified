This
test
verifies
that
when
an
event
has
multiple
listeners
that
the
/
/
unregistration
of
an
unrelated
listener
does
not
prevent
other
listeners
/
/
from
being
notified
.
This
is
a
regression
test
for
bug
1317154
where
proxied
/
/
event
listeners
were
identified
by
the
API
path
(
e
.
g
.
storage
.
onChanged
)
/
/
and
any
removeListener
call
would
stop
other
listeners
from
being
notified
.
