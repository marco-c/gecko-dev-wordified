Quitting
while
an
extension
is
starting
should
not
block
shutdown
.
/
/
Previously
if
an
extension
was
starting
at
application
startup
and
the
/
/
application
quit
before
the
background
page
startup
completed
then
the
/
/
implementation
would
wait
indefinitely
for
the
completion
of
background
/
/
startup
(
which
would
not
trigger
because
past
shutdown
any
attempt
to
load
/
/
content
is
aborted
with
NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_DURING_SHUTDOWN
)
