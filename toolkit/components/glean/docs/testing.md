Testing
Given
the
multiple
API
languages
processes
and
dependencies
testing
FOG
is
a
matter
of
choosing
the
right
tool
for
the
situation
.
#
#
Logging
An
often
-
overlooked
first
line
of
testing
is
"
what
do
the
logs
say
?
"
.
To
turn
on
logging
for
FOG
use
any
of
the
following
:
*
Run
Firefox
with
RUST_LOG
=
"
glean
=
info
fog
=
info
glean_core
=
info
"
.
*
On
some
platforms
this
will
use
terminal
colours
to
indicate
log
level
.
*
Run
Firefox
with
MOZ_LOG
=
"
timestamp
glean
:
:
*
:
5
fog
:
:
*
:
5
glean_core
:
:
*
:
5
"
.
*
Set
the
following
prefs
:
*
logging
.
config
.
timestamp
to
true
*
logging
.
fog
:
:
*
to
5
*
logging
.
glean
:
:
*
to

*
logging
.
glean_core
:
:
*
to
5

Rust
Not
all
of
our
Rust
code
can
be
tested
in
a
single
fashion
unfortunately
.
#
#
#
Using
rusttests
If
the
crate
you
'
re
testing
has
no
Gecko
symbols
you
can
write
standard
[
Rust
tests
]
(

html
)
.
This
supports
both
unit
tests
(
inline
in
the
file
under
test
)
and
integration
tests
(
in
the
tests
/
folder
in
the
crate
root
)
.
To
run
FOG
'
s
rusttests
suite
use
mach
rusttests
#
#
#
Using
gtest
Because
Gecko
symbols
aren
'
t
built
for
the
rusttests
build
any
test
that
is
written
for
a
crate
that
uses
Gecko
symbols
should
be
written
as
a
[
gtest
]
(
https
:
/
/
github
.
com
/
google
/
googletest
)
in
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
gtest
/
.
By
necessity
these
can
only
be
integration
tests
against
the
compiled
crate
.
*
*
Note
:
*
*
When
adding
a
new
test
file
don
'
t
forget
to
add
it
to
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
gtest
/
moz
.
build
and
use
the
FOG
prefix
in
your
test
names
.
To
run

use
