New
Metrics

Pings

Note
:
*
*
FOG
is
not
ready
to
be
used
so
you
probably
should
not
be
adding
metrics
and
pings
using
this
guide
yet
.
Instead
please
use
Firefox
Telemetry
unless
you
have
explicitly
been
given
permission
by
a
[
Telemetry
Module
Peer
]
(
https
:
/
/
wiki
.
mozilla
.
org
/
Modules
/
All
#
Telemetry
)
.
To
add
a
new
metric
or
ping
to
Firefox
Desktop
you
should
follow
the
[
Glean
SDK
documentation
on
the
subject
]
(

/
mozilla
.

.

.
html
)
with
some
few
twists
.
#
#
IPC
Firefox
Desktop
is
made
of
multiple
processes
.
You
can
record
data
from
any
process
in
Firefox
Desktop
[
subject
to
certain
conditions
]
(
ipc
.
md
)
.
If
you
will
be
recording
data
to
this
metric
in
multiple
processes
you
should
make
yourself
aware
of
those
conditions
.

Where
do
I
Define
new
Metrics
and
Pings
?
Metrics
and
pings
are
defined
in
their
definitions
files
(
metrics
.
yaml
or
pings
.
yaml
respectively
)
.
But
where
can
you
find
metrics
.
yaml
or
pings
.
yaml
?
If
you
'
re
not
the
first
person
in
your
component
to
ask
that
question
the
answer
is
likely
"
in
the
root
of
your
component
"
.
Look
for
the
definitions
files
near
to
where
you
are
instrumenting
your
code
.
If
you
_are_
the
first
person
in
your
component
to
ask
that
question
you
get
to
choose
where
to
start
them
!
We
recommend
adding
them
in
the
root
of
your
component
next
to
a
moz
.
build
.
When
you
do
so
be
sure
to
edit
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
moz
.
build
adding
your
definitions
files
to
the
GeneratedFile
directives
therein
.
If
you
don
'
t
no
API
will
be
generated
for
your
metrics
and
your
build
will
fail
.
In
addition
do
not
forget
to
file
a
bug
in
Data
Platform
and
Tools
:
:
General
asking
for
your
definitions
files
to
be
added
to
the
others
for
firefox
.
desktop
.
If
you
don
'
t
your
metrics
will
not
show
up
in
datasets
and
tools
because
the
pipeline
won
'
t
know
that
they
exist
.
If
you
have
any
questions
be
sure
to
ask
on
[
the
#
glean
channel
]
(

Do
_not_
use
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
metrics
.
yaml
or
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
pings
.
yaml
.
These
are
for
metrics
instrumenting
the
code
under

and
are
not
general
-
purpose
locations
for
adding
metrics
and
pings
.
