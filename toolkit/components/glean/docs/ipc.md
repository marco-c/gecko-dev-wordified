Inter

process
Communication
(
IPC
)
Firefox
Desktop
is
a
multi
-
process
desktop
application
.
Code
requiring
instrumentation
may
be
on
any
of
its
processes
so
FOG
needs
to
provide
facilities
to
enable
that
.
#
#
Design
The
IPC
Design
of
FOG
was
worked
out
in
[
bug
1618253
]
(

)
.
It
centred
around
a
few
specific
concepts
:
#
#
#
Forbidding
Non
-
Commutative
Operations
Because
we
cannot
nicely
impose
a
canonical
ordering
of
metric
operations
across
all
processes
FOG
forbids
non

commutative

wikipedia
.

Commutative_property
)
metric
operations
in
some
circumstances
.
For
example
Add
(
)
-
ing
to
a
Counter
metric
works
from
multiple
processes
because
the
order
doesn
'
t
matter
.
However
given
a
String
metric
being
Set
(
)
from
multiple
processes
simultaneously
which
value
should
it
take
?
This
ambiguity
is
not
a
good
foundation
to
build
trust
on
so
we
forbid
setting
a
String
metric
from
multiple
processes
.
__TODO__
:
Expand
on
what
exactly
is
forbidden
and
when
.
Do
we
permit
actions
on
string
metrics
so
long
as
they
only
happen
on
one
process
?
Do
we
forbid
any
actions
on
string
metrics
from
non
-
main
processes
?

Process
Agnosticism
For
metric
types
that
can
be
used
cross
-
process
FOG
provides
no
facility
for
identifying
which
process
the
instrumentation
is
on
.
What
this
means
is
that
if
you
accumulate
to
a
[
Timing
Distribution
]
(
https
:
/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
glean
/
book
/
user
/
metrics
/
timing_distribution
.
html
)
in
multiple
processes
all
the
samples
from
all
the
processes
will
be
combined
in
the
same
metric
.
If
you
wish
to
distinguish
samples
from
different
process
types
you
will
need
multiple
metrics
and
inline
code
to
select
the
proper
one
for
the
given
process
.
For
example
:
C
+
+
if
(
XRE_GetProcessType
(
)
=
=
GeckoProcessType_Default
)
{
mozilla
:
:
glean
:
:
performance
:
:
cache_size
.
Accumulate
(
numBytes
/
1024
)
;
}
else
{
mozilla
:
:
glean
:
:
performance
:
:
non_main_process_cache_size
.
Accumulate
(
numBytes
/
1024
)
;
}

#
Scheduling
FOG
makes
no
guarantee
about
when
non
-
main
-
process
metric
values
are
sent
across
IPC
.
FOG
will
try
its
best
to
schedule
opportunistically
in
idle
moments
.
There
are
a
few
cases
where
we
provide
more
firm
guarantees
:
#
#
#
#
Tests
There
are
test
-
only
APIs
in
Rust
C
+
+
and
Javascript
that
expose
when
a
complete
flush
of
child
process
metric
values
has
completed
.

test
documentation

will

FOG
uses
messages
on
the
PContent
protocol
.
This
enables
communication
between
content
child
processes
and
the
parent
process
.
The
rough
design
is
that
the
Parent
can
request
an
immediate
flush
of
pending
data
and
each
Child
can
decide
to
flush
its
pending
data
whenever
it
wishes
.
Pending
Data
is
a
buffer
of
bytes
generated
by
bincode
in
Rust
in
the
Child
handed
off
to
C
+
+
passed
over
IPC
then
given
back
to
bincode
in
Rust
on
the
Parent
.
