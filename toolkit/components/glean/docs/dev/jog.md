Sorry
Why
is
it
caled
JOG
?
Because
it
'
s
concerned
with
.
.
.
run
.
.
.
time
.
The
normal
mechanism
for
registering
metrics
for
reasons
as
varied
from
ease
-
of
-
impl
to
performance
happens
at
compile
time
.
However
this
doesn
'
t
support
use
cases
like
*
[
Artifact
Builds
]
[
artifact
-
build
]
(
Where
only
the
JavaScript
of
Firefox
Desktop
is
repackaged
at
build
time
so
there
is
no
compile
environment
)
*
Dynamic
Telemetry
(
A
theorized
system
for
instrumenting
Firefox
Desktop
without
shipping
code
)
*
Web
Extensions
(
Or
at
least
the
kind
that
can
'
t
or
won
'
t
use
[
the
Glean
JS
SDK
]
[
glean
-
js
]
)
Thus
we
need
a
subsystem
that
supports
the
runtime
registration
of
metrics
.
We
call
it
JOG
and
it
was
implemented
in
[
bug

]
.
#
#
JavaScript
Only
Metrics
in
C
+
+
and
Rust
are
identified
by
identifiers
which
we
can
'
t
swap
out
at
runtime
.
Thus
in
order
for
changes
to
metrics
to
be
visible
to
instrumented
systems
in
C
+
+
or
Rust
you
must
compile
.
JavaScript
on
the
other
hand
we
supply
instances
to
on
-
demand
.
It
not
only
supports
the
specific
use
cases
driving
this
project
it
'
s
the
only
environment
that
can
benefit
from
runtime
metric
definition
in
Firefox
Desktop
.

#
Design
The
original
design
was
done
as
part
of
[
bug
1662863
]
[
design
-
bug
]
.
Things
have
mostly
just
been
refined
from
there
.
#
#
Architecture
We
silo
as
much
of
the
subsystem
as
we
can
into
the
jog
module
located
in
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
bindings
/
jog
/
.
This
includes
the
metrics
construction
factory
and
storage
for
metrics
instances
and
their
names
and
ids
.
Unfortunately
so
that
the
metrics
instances
can
be
accessed
by
FFI
the
Rust
metrics
instances
created
by
the
jog
crate
are
stored
within
the
fog
crate
.
Speaking
of
FFI
the
jog
crate
is
using
cbindgen
to
be
accessible
to
C
+
+
.
If
necessary
or
pleasant
it
is
probably
possible
to
do
away
with
the
C
+
+
storage
moving
the
category
set
and
metrics
id
map
to
Rust
and
moving
information
over
FFI
as
needed
.
Test
methods
are
run
from
nsIFOG
(
so
we
can
use
them
in
JS
in
xpcshell
)
to
static
JOG
