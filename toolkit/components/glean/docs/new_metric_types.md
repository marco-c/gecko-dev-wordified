Adding
a
New
Metric
Type
This
document
covers
how
to
add
a
new
metric
type
to
FOG
.
You
should
only
have
to
do
this
if
a
new
metric
type
is
added
to
the
[
Glean
SDK
]
(

/
/
mozilla
.
github
.
io
/
glean
/

and
it
is
needed
in
Firefox

IPC
For
detailed
information
about
the
IPC
design
including
a
list
of
forbidden
operations
please
consult
[
the
FOG
IPC
documentation
]
(
ipc
.
md
)
.
When
adding
a
new
metric
type
the
main
IPC
considerations
are
:
*
Which
operations
are
forbidden
because
they
are
not
commutative
?
*
Most
set
-
style
operations
cannot
be
reconciled
sensibly
across
multiple
processes
.
*
If
there
are
non
-
forbidden
operations
what
partial
representation
will
this
metric
have
in
non
-
main
processes
?
Put
another
way
what
shape
of
storage
will
this
take
up
in
the
[
IPC
Payload
]

/

/

.
rs
)
?
*
For
example
Counters
can
aggregate
all
partial
counts
together
to
a
single
"
partial
sum
"
.
So
[
its
representation
]

)
in
the
IPC
Payload
is
just
a
single
number
per
Counter
.
*
In
contrast
Timing
Distributions
'
durations
are
calculated
in
the
core
so
it
can
'
t
calculate
samples
in
child
processes
.
Instead
we
will
need
to
record
the
start
and
stop
instants
as
pairs
more
or
less
sending
a
command
stream
with
timing
information
.
To
implement
IPC
support
in
a
metric
type
we
split
the
metric
into
three
pieces
:
1
.
An
umbrella
enum
with
the
name
MetricTypeMetric
.
*
It
has
a
Child
and
a
Parent
variant
.
*
It
is
IPC
-
aware
and
is
responsible
for
*
If
on
a
non
-
parent
-
process
either
storing
partial
representations
in
the
IPC
Payload
or
logging
errors
if
forbidden
non
-
test
APIs
are
called
.
(
Or
panicking
if
test
APIs
are
called
.
)
*
If
on
the
parent
process
dispatching
API
calls
to
the
core
.
2
.
The
MetricTypeImpl
is
the
parent
-
process
implementation
.
*
It
talks
to
the
core
and
supports
test
APIs
too
.
3
.
The
MetricTypeIpc
is
the
ipc
-
aware
non
-
parent
-
process
implementation
.
*
It
stores
the
MetricId
that
identifies
this
particular
metric
in
a
cross
-
process
fashion
.
*
*
Note
:
*
*
This
will
change
once
the
Rust
Language
Binding
is
moved
into

Rust
FOG
is
being
used
to
test
out
the
ergonomics
of
a
public
Rust
API
so
has
been
granted
special
permission
to
implement
directly
atop
glean_core
.
For
now
.
The
Rust
API
is
implemented
in
the
[
private
module
of
the
fog
crate
]
(
https
:
/
/
hg
.
mozilla
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
file
/
tip
/
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
api
/
src
/
metrics
)
.
Each
metric
gets
its
own
file
mimicking
the
structure
in
[
glean_core
]
(
https
:
/
/
github
.
com
/
mozilla
/
glean
/
tree
/
master
/
glean
-
core
/
src
/
metrics
)
.
Every
method
on
the
metric
type
is
public
for
now
including
test
methods
.
To
allow
for
pre
-
init
instrumentation
to
work
(
and
to
be
sensitive
to
performance
in
the
event
that
metric
recording
is
expensive
)
each
write
to
a
metric
is
dispatched
to
another
thread
using
the
[
Dispatcher
]
(
https
:
/
/
hg
.
mozilla
.
org
/
mozilla
-
central
/
file
/
tip
/
toolkit
/
components
/
glean
/
api
/
src
/
dispatcher
/
mod
.
rs
)
.
Test
methods
must
first
call
dispatcher
:
:
block_on_queue
(
)
before
retrieving
stored
data
to
ensure
pending
operations
have
been
completed
before
we
read
the
value
