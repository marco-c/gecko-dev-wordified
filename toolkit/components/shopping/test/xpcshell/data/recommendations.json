pros

The
battery
life
is
unreal
.
Having
a
good
solar
charger
really
helps
out
.
Garmin
once
again
has
nailed
a
product
.
"
"
Apples
watch
stands
out
so
much
its
an
annoucement
.
It
reminds
me
of
my
pebble
watches
.
"
"
Most
of
the
functionality
comes
from
the
sensor
but
it
'
s
far
superior
in
every
other
aspect
.
The
watch
menus
aren
'
t
a
problem
if
you
'
re
ok
dealing
with
complex
little
gadgets
.
It
seems
to
be
great
at
a
lot
of
other
things
too
but
i
'
m
not
familiar
enough
to
discuss
.
"
"
The
companion
android
app
is
very
good
.
The
phone
finder
works
well
.
It
'
s
easy
to
see
quick
snippets
of
emails
or
texts
on
the
watch
.
"
]
"
cons
"
:
[
"
Garmin
restricts
language
compatibility
based
on
region
.
They
sell
a
tactical
branded
watch
and
then
don
'
t
warranty
their
glass
.
