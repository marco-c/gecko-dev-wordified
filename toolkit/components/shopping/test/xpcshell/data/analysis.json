Other
than
that
I
am
very
impressed
with
the
watch
and
it
s
capabilities

This
watch
performs
above
expectations
in
every
way
with
the
exception
of
the
heart
rate
monitor

Battery

no
better

the

even
with
the
solar

probably
worse

Bought
this

vivoactive
3

I
like
that
this
watch
has
so
many
features
especially
those
that
monitor
health
like
SP02
respiration
sleep
HRV
status
stress
and
heart
rate

I
do
not
use
it
for
sleep
or
heartrate
monitoring
so
not
sure
how
accurate
they
are
.

I
'
ve
avoided
getting
a
smartwatch
for
so
long
due
to
short
battery

on
most
of
them
