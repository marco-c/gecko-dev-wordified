This
ping
is
used
to
report
when
BackgroundHangReporter
has
detected
that
the
browser
was
unresponsive
.
BackgroundHangReporter
is
only
enabled
for
pre
-
release
channels
(
currently
only
on
Nightly
)
and
only
on
specific
threads
(
main
renderer
)
.
Whenever
a
runnable
starts
being
processed
on
the
event
loop
BHR
starts
a
128ms
timer
.
If
the
runnable
finishes
quickly
enough
and
execution
returns
to
the
event
loop
before
the
timer
fired
the
timer
is
canceled
.
When
the
timer
fires
the
execution
is
paused
and
a
profiler
stack
is
captured
.
These
stacks
contain
native
frames
(
which
need
to
be
symbolicated
to
become
readable
)
label
frames
and
JavaScript
frame
giving
detailed
information
about
what
was
on
the
stack
at
the
time
the
timer
fired
.
Once
the
stack
has
been
recorded
execution
resumes
and
the
total
time
it
took
to
finish
the
hanging
task
and
return
to
the
event
loop
is
recorded
.
If
the
execution
didn
'
t
return
to
the
event
loop
after
8
seconds
we
assume
we
have
a
'
perma
-
hang
'
that
we
will
not
be
able
to
recover
from
and
record
the
duration
as
8
seconds
.
Stack
are
sanitized
to
not
reveal
any
information
about
remote
content
.
Pings
are
submitted
daily
when
idle
during
clean
shutdowns
or
when
50
reports
have
been
accumulated
