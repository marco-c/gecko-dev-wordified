This
module
provides
an
asynchronous
API
for
managing
bookmarks
.
*
*
Bookmarks
are
organized
in
a
tree
structure
and
can
be
bookmarked
URIs
*
folders
or
separators
.
Multiple
bookmarks
for
the
same
URI
are
allowed
.
*
*
Note
that
if
you
are
handling
bookmarks
operations
in
the
UI
you
should
*
not
use
this
API
directly
but
rather
use
PlacesTransactions
.
jsm
so
that
*
any
operation
is
undo
/
redo
-
able
.
*
*
Each
bookmarked
item
is
represented
by
an
object
having
the
following
*
properties
:
*
*
-
guid
(
string
)
*
The
globally
unique
identifier
of
the
item
.
*
-
parentGuid
(
string
)
*
The
globally
unique
identifier
of
the
folder
containing
the
item
.
*
This
will
be
an
empty
string
for
the
Places
root
folder
.
*
-
index
(
number
)
*
The
0
-
based
position
of
the
item
in
the
parent
folder
.
*
-
dateAdded
(
number
microseconds
from
the
epoch
)
*
The
time
at
which
the
item
was
added
.
This
is
a
PRTime
(
microseconds
)
.
*
-
lastModified
(
number
microseconds
from
the
epoch
)
*
The
time
at
which
the
item
was
last
modified
.
This
is
a
PRTime
(
microseconds
)
.
*
-
type
(
number
)
*
The
item
'
s
type
either
TYPE_BOOKMARK
TYPE_FOLDER
or
TYPE_SEPARATOR
.
*
*
The
following
properties
are
only
valid
for
bookmarks
or
folders
.
*
*
-
title
(
string
)
*
The
item
'
s
title
if
any
.
Empty
titles
and
null
titles
are
considered
*
the
same
and
the
property
is
unset
on
retrieval
in
such
a
case
.
*
*
The
following
properties
are
only
valid
for
bookmarks
:
*
*
-
uri
(
nsIURI
)
*
The
item
'
s
URI
.
*
-
keyword
(
string
)
*
The
associated
keyword
if
any
.
*
*
Each
successful
operation
notifies
through
the
nsINavBookmarksObserver
*
interface
.
To
listen
to
such
notifications
you
must
register
using
*
nsINavBookmarksService
addObserver
and
removeObserver
methods
.
*
Note
that
bookmark
addition
or
order
changes
won
'
t
notify
onItemMoved
for
*
items
that
have
their
indexes
changed
.
*
Similarly
lastModified
changes
not
done
explicitly
(
like
changing
another
*
property
)
won
'
t
fire
an
onItemChanged
notification
for
the
lastModified
*
property
.
*
see
nsINavBookmarkObserver
*
*
note
livemarks
are
implemented
as
empty
folders
.

Creates

If
the

the

is
updated
otherwise

a

is
created

to

a

reason
such
as

an

you
should
not
do
that
