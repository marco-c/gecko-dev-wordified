Tests
that
recalc_frecency
in
the
moz_origins
table
works
is
consistent
.
/

This
test
does
not
completely
cover
origins
frecency
recalculation
because
/
/
the
current
system
uses
temp
tables
and
triggers
to
make
the
recalculation

but
it
'
s
likely
that
will
change
in
the
future
and
then
we
can
add
to
this
