#
Internal
URLs
Firefox
and
other
Gecko
applications
use
several
URL
schemes
(
protocols
)
for
internal
or
"
special
"
resources
.
The
main
ones
are
:
<
!
-
-
no
toc
-
-
>
-
[
moz
-
src
URLs
]
(
#
moz
-
src
-
urls
)
-
[
resource
URLs
]
(
#
resource
-
urls
)
-
[
chrome
URLs
]
(
#
chrome
-
urls
)
There
are
other
special
protocols
like
moz
-
icon
and
various
places
URLs
but
at
the
moment
they
are
not
covered
here
.
#
#
moz
-
src
URLs
URLs
look
like
:
moz
-
src
:
/
/
/
browser
/
components
/
BrowserGlue
.
sys
.
mjs
.
Note
that
there
is
no
"
host
"
component
(
nothing
between
the
second
and
third
slash
)
.
In
future
we
may
support
non
-
empty
hosts
with
specific
meanings
.
For
now
always
use
a
triple
slash
.
Everything
after
this
is
the
full
source
path
of
the
file
you
are
referencing
.
Of
course
this
is
an
abstraction
:
the
URL
will
only
work
if
the
file
is
actually
packaged
.
#
#
#
Packaging
To
package
a
file
for
use
via
moz
-
src
include
it
in
a
[
moz
.
build
file
]
[
mozbuild
-
files
]
inside
a
MOZ_SRC_FILES
instruction
.
All
files
are
packaged
in
the
toolkit
omni
.
ja
file
.
Internally
the
URL
is
translated
into
a
jar
:
file
URL
into
the
toolkit
(
gre
)
omni
.
ja
file
.

Security
considerations
Only
privileged
(
system
principal
/
"
chrome
"
privileged
)
code
can
load
or
link
to
moz
-
src
URLs
.
The
intention
is
that
in
future
we
make
it
possible
to
have
more
fine
-
grained
restrictions
for
moz
-
src
URLs
with
non
-
empty
"
host
"
portions
(
e
.
g
.
moz
-
src
:
/
/
about
/
for
content
only
accessible
to
about
:
pages
)
but
this
has
not
yet
been
implemented
.
#
#
resource
URLs
URLs
look
like
resource
:
/
/
mapping
/
optional
/
path
/
components
/
file
.
txt
.
Here
mapping
is
an
arbitrary
identifier
chosen
elsewhere
.
There
are
3
builtin
mappings
of
note
:
-
gre
(
"
Gecko
Runtime
Environment
"
)
for
some
of
the
content
inside
the
"
toolkit
"
omni
.
ja
file
-
app
for
some
of
the
content
inside
the
"
browser
"
(
or
other
application
-
specific
)
omni
.
ja
file
.
-
android
on
Android
for
APK
contents
.
The
app
mapping
is
the
default
which
means
that
if
you
use
a
resource
URL
without
a
host
component
(
resource
:
/
/
/
whatever
)
it
is
equivalent
to
the
app
URL
:
resource
:
/
/
app
/
whatever
.
Each
mapping
is
resolved
to
a
URL
in
the
resource
URL
protocol
handler
after
which
any
subsequent
path
/
file
components
are
resolved
relative
to
that
URL
.
Additional
mappings
can
be
added
via
a
[
chrome
.
manifest
instruction
]
[
resource
-
map
]
.
Builtin
extensions
make
use
of
this
as
do
[
some
components
]
[
searchfox
-
res
-
reg
]
.

of

Security
considerations
By
default
resource
URLs
cannot
be
accessed
by
web
content
and
are
restricted
to
privileged
(
system
principal
/
"
chrome
"
privileged
)
code
.
However
you
can
register
a
resource
mapping
with
contentaccessible
=
yes
in
order
to
"
holepunch
"
this
restriction
.
Note
that
this
means
_everything_
packaged
under
that
path
becomes
linkable
and
loadable
by
all
web
content
.
With
few
exceptions
(
like
user
agent
stylesheets
)
that
is
not
what
you
want
.
Unfortunately
more
fine
-
grained
restrictions
are
not
available
for
resource
URLs
.

chrome

chrome

take
one
of
three
forms
:

properties
The
first
(
"
host
"
)
component
after
chrome
:
/
/
is
the
*
*
package
name
*
*
.
Common
ones
are
browser
(
for
front
-
end
Desktop
Firefox
files
)
and
global
(
for
content
used
by
Gecko
/
toolkit
code
)
but
different
parts
of
the
codebase
can
and
do
register
their
own
packages
.
The
second
component
after
chrome
:
/
/
{
packagename
}
/
is
always
one
of
content
skin
or
locale
known
as
"
providers
"
.
They
cater
to
JS
and
HTML
(
content
)
style
information
(
skin
)
and
old

style
.
properties
localization
files
(
locale
)
.
Any
path
portions
after
the
provider
are
relative
paths
to
where
that
particular
package
&
provider
combination
is
pointing
.

Depending

how

the

are
typically
packaged
into

it
is
possible
to
