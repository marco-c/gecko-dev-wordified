We
respond
to
two
types
of
messages
:
*
1
)
"
Do
"
messages
.
These
are
requests
from
the
ZoomChild
that
represent
*
action
requests
from
the
platform
code
.
We
pass
these
events
on
to
*
the
frontend
FullZoom
actor
that
will
take
the
requested
action
.
*
2
)
ZoomChange
messages
.
These
are
updates
from
the
ZoomChild
that
*
changes
have
already
been
made
to
the
zoom
.
We
pass
these
events
on
*
other
listeners
so
that
they
can
also
update
state
.
FullZoom
has
*
a
PostFullZoomChange
method
to
support
automated
testing
which
*
needs
to
know
that
both
the
zoom
has
changed
and
the
resolution
has
*
been
updated
by
the
ZoomChild
.
TextZoom
has
no
such
requirement
and
*
therefore
no
need
for
a
PostTextZoomChange
event
.
