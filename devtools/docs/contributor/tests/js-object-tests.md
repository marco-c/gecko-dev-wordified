JavaScript
Objects
test
framework
JSObjectsTestUtils
.
sys
.
mjs
exposes
xpcshell
and
mochitest
test
helpers
to
easily
test
all
the
arbitrary
JavaScript
object
types
that
Gecko
can
spawn
in
JavaScript
.
This
includes
:
*
any
JavaScript
type
that
Spidermonkey
supports
*
any
JavaScript
type
exposed
to
Web
Page
from
Gecko
(
All
the
DOM
APIs
)
*
any
JavaScript
type
only
exposed
to
Worker
threads
*
any
privileged
JavaScript
type
used
in
parent
or
content
processes
*
.
.
.
This
test
framework
consists
in
:
*
a
manifest
file
[
AllJavaScriptTypes
.
mjs
]
(

which
defines
all
the
JS
objects
that
gecko
can
spawn
*
one
xpcshell
or
one
mochitest
file
using
[
JSObjectsTestUtils

helper
to
evaluate
all
the
JS
Objects
and
generate
a
value
for
each
of
them
.
*
a
snapshot
file
read
and
written
by
JSObjectsTestUtils
specific
to
each
xpcshell
/
mochitest
and
storing
all
its
the
generated
values
.
You
can
run
your
test
to
execute
the
assertions
:
bash
.
/
mach
test
my
/
browser_test
.
js
And
you
can
update
the
snapshot
by
running
:
bash
.
/
mach
test
my
/
browser_test
.
js
-
-
setenv
UPDATE_SNAPSHOT
=
true
You
also
can
run
all
the
tests
with
:
bash
.
/
mach
xpcshell
-
test
-
-
tag
object
-
snapshots
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-

And
update
all
the
snapshots
with
:
bash

.
/

-
-
setenv
UPDATE_SNAPSHOT
=

(
you
may
use
.
/
mach
test
but
it
will
run
some
unexpected
tests
be
slower
and
report
unrelated
errors
)

JSObjectsTestUtils
APIs
This
test
helper
is
available
to
all
xpcshell
and
mochitest
tests
from
resource
:
/
/
testing
-
common
/
JSObjectsTestUtils
.
sys
.
mjs
.
It
exposes
only
two
methods
:
*
JSOBjectsTestUtils
.
init
(
testScope
)
Which
is
meant
to
be
called
early
in
the
test
run
before
the
test
page
is
loaded
.
This
will
update
all
preferences
which
helps
enable
all
the
experimental
types
or
ease
instantiating
them
.
The
global
scope
for
the
current
test
should
be
passed
as
argument
.
This
will
be
used
to
retrieve
the
current
test
location
in
order
to
load
the
expected
values
from
an
ES
Module
located
in
the
same
folder
as
the
current
test
.
*
JSOBjectsTestUtils
.
runTest
(
expectedValuesFileName
testFunction
)
This
is
the
main
method
which
will
call
the
testFunction
for
each
JavaScript
object
example
.
This
method
will
receive
a
single
argument
which
is
an
object
with
two
attributes
:
*
context
A
string
whose
value
can
be
one
of

We

This
is
the
most
important
part
where
we
evaluate
the
expression
provided
by
the
test
framework

/
in
the
test
page
and
return
the
value
we
would
like
to
assert
over
time
.

We
have
to
ensure
handling
exception
which
we
expect
to
interpret
as
a
returned
value
.
let
value

try
{
value

Here
we
cover
the
native
stringification
of
all
the
JS

#
#
AllJavaScriptTypes
manifest
All
the
JavaScript
object
examples
are
stored
in
a
manifest
file
located
in
the
current
folder
:
AllJavaScriptTypes
.
mjs
.
This
module
exports
an
array
of
objects
descriptions
which
are
objects
with
the
two
following
attributes
:
*
context
:
A
String
to
designate
the
context
into
which
this
expression
could
be
evaluated
.
See
the
first
paragraph
for
the
list
of
all
contexts
.
*
expression
:
The
JavaScript
expression
to
evaluate
which
can
either
be
:
*
a
string
representing
a
piece
of
JavaScript
value
.
*
a
function
which
would
be
stringified
and
evaluated
in
many
scopes
.
This
is
to
be
used
when
you
need
intermediate
value
before
spawning
another
specific
JS
Value
.
If
the
expression
throws
the
thrown
exception
will
be
considered
as
the
value
to
assert
.
The
object
descriptions
can
also
have
a
couple
of
optional
attributes
:
*
prefs
:
An
array
of
arrays
.
The
nested
array
are
made
of
two
elements
:
a
string
and
a
value
.
The
string
represents
a
preference
name
and
the
value
the
preference
value
.
This
is
used
to
set
preference
before
starting
the
test
.
This
helps
enable
as
well
as
ease
instantiating
the
related
JS
value
.
*
disabled
:
A
boolean
to
be
set
to
true
if
the
value
can
'
t
be
instantiated
on
the
current
runtime
.
