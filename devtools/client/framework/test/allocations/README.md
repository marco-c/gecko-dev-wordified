Allocation
tests
This
folder
contains
special
mochitests
which
are
meant
to
record
data
about
the
memory
usage
of
DevTools
.
This
uses
Spidermonkey
'
s
Memory
API
implemented
next
to
the
debugger
API
.

Execute
preliminary
setup
in
order
to
be
able
to
run
your
scenario
/
/
You
would
typicaly
load
modules
open
a
tab
a
toolbox
.
.
.
.
.
.
/
/
Run
the
test
scenario
first
before
recording
in
order
to
load
all
the
/
/
modules
.
Otherwise
they
get
reported
as
"
still
allocated
"
objects
/
/
whereas
we
do
expect
them
to
be
kept
in
memory
as
they
are
loaded
via
/
/
the
main
DevTools
loader
which
keeps
the
module
loaded
until
the
/
/
shutdown
of
Firefox
await
testScript
(
)
;
/
/
Pass
alsoRecordContentProcess
if
you
want
to
record
the
content
process
/
/
of
the
current
tab
.
Otherwise
it
will
only
record
parent
process
objects
.
await
startRecordingAllocations
(
{
alsoRecordContentProcess
:
true
}
)
;
/
/
Now
run
the
test
script
.
This
time
we
record
this
run
.
await
testScript
(
toolbox
)
;
/
/
This
will
stop
the
record
and
also
publish
the
results
to
Talos
database
/
/
Second
argument
will
be
the
name
of
the
test
displayed
in
Talos
.
/
/
Many
tests
will
be
recorded
but
all
of
them
will
be
prefixed
with
this
string
.
await
stopRecordingAllocations
(
"
reload
"
{
alsoRecordContentProcess
:
true
}
)
;
/
/
Then
here
you
can
execute
cleanup
.
/
/
You
would
typically
close
the
tab
toolbox
.

Debug
leaks
If
you
are
seeing
a
regression
or
an
improvement
only
seeing
the
number
of
objects
being
leaked
isn
'
t
super
helpful
.
The
tests
includes
some
special
debug
modes
which
are
printing
lots
of
data
to
figure
out
what
is
leaking
and
why
.
You
may
run
the
test
with
the
following
env
variable
to
turn
debug
mode
on
:
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
=
leak
|
allocations
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
headless
devtools
/
client
/
framework
/
test
/
allocations
/
the
-
fault
-
test
.
js
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
can
enable
two
distinct
debug
output
.
(
Only
one
can
be
enabled
at
a
given
time
)
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
=
allocations
will
report
all
allocation
sites
that
have
been
made
while
running
your
test
.
This
will
include
allocations
which
has
been
freed
.
This
view
is
especially
useful
if
you
want
to
reduce
allocations
in
order
to
reduce
GC
overload
.
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
=
leak
will
report
only
the
allocations
which
are
still
allocated
at
the
end
of
your
test
.
Sometimes
it
will
only
report
allocations
with
missing
stack
trace
.
Thus
making
the
preview
view
helpful
.
#
#
Example
Let
'
s
assume
we
have
the
following
code
:
1
:
exports
.
MyModule
=
{
2
:
globalArray
:
[
]
3
:
test
(
)
{
3
:
/
/
The
following
object
will
be
allocated
but
not
leaked
5
:
/
/
as
we
keep
no
reference
to
it
anywhere
6
:
const
transientObject
=
{
}
;
7
:
8
:
/
/
The
following
object
will
be
allocated
on
this
line
9
:
/
/
but
leaked
on
the
following
one
.
By
storing
a
reference
10
:
/
/
to
it
in
the
global
array
which
is
never
cleared
.
11
:
const
leakedObject
=
{
}
;
12
:
this
.
globalArray
.
push
(
leakedObject
)
;
13
:
}
14
:
}
;
And
that
we
have
a
memory
test
doing
this
:
const
{
MyModule
}
=
require
(
"
devtools
/
my
-
module
"
)
;
await
startRecordingAllocations
(
)
;
MyModule
.
test
(
)
;
await
stopRecordingAllocations
(
"
target
"
)
;
We
can
first
review
all
the
allocations
by
running
:
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
=
allocations
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
headless
devtools
/
client
/
framework
/
test
/
allocations
/
browser_allocation_myTest
.
js
which
will
print
at
the
end
:
DEVTOOLS
ALLOCATION
:
all
allocations
(
which
may
be
freed
or
are
still
allocated
)
:
[
{
"
src
"
:
"
UNKNOWN
"
"
count
"
:
80
"
lines
"
:
[
"
?
:
80
"
]
}
{
"
src
"
:
"
resource
:
/
/
devtools
/
my
-
module
.
js
"
"
count
"
:
2
"
lines
"
:
[
"
11
:
1
"
"
6
:
1
"
]
}
]
The
first
part
with
"
UNKNOWN
"
can
be
ignored
.
This
is
about
objects
with
missing
allocation
sites
.
The
second
part
of
this
logs
tells
us
that
2
objects
were
allocated
from
my
-
module
.
js
when
running
the
test
.
One
has
been
allocated
at
line
6
it
is
transcientObject
.
Another
one
has
been
allocated
at
line
11
it
is
leakedObject
.
Now
we
can
use
the
second
view
to
focus
only
on
objects
that
have
been
kept
allocated
:
DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_ALLOCATIONS
=
leaks
.
/
mach
mochitest
-
-
headless
devtools
/
client
/
framework
/
test
/
allocations
/
browser_allocation_myTest
.
js
which
will
print
at
the
end
:
DEVTOOLS
ALLOCATION
:
allocations
which
leaked
:
[
{
"
src
"
:
"
UNKNOWN
"
"
count
"
:
80
"
lines
"
:
[
"
?
:
80
"
]
}
{
"
src
"
:
"
resource
:
/
/
devtools
/
shared
/
commands
/
commands
-
factory
.
js
"
"
count
"
:
1
"
lines
"
:
[
"
11
:
1
"
]
}
]
Similarly
we
can
focus
only
on
the
second
part
which
tells
us
that
only
one
object
is
being
leaked
and
this
object
has
been
originally
created
from
line
11
this
is
leakedObject
.
This
doesn
'
t
tell
us
why
the
object
is
being
kept
allocated
but
at
least
we
know
which
one
is
being
kept
in
memory
.
