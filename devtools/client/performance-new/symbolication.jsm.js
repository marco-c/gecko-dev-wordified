This

a

running

that

was
compiled
by
the
developer
on

this

machine
(
the

In

/
that
case
the
objdir
will
contain
the
compiled
binary
with
full
symbol
and
/
/
debug
information
whereas
the
binary
on
the
device
may
not
exist
in

uncompressed
form
or
may
have
been
stripped
of
debug
information

some

information

An
objdir
or
"
object
directory
"
is
a
directory
on
the
host
machine
that
'
s
/
/
used
to
store
build
artifacts
(
"
object
files
"
)
from
the
compilation
process
.
/
/
This
only
works
if
the
binary
is
one
of
the
Gecko
binaries
and
not
/
/
a
system
library

Also
search

directory
itself
(
not
just
in

.
/
/
If
for
some
unforeseen
reason
the
relevant
binary
is
not
inside
the
/
/
objdirs
dist

directory
this
provides
a
way
out

do
this
after

*
*
This
is
needed
for
the
following
reason
:
*
-
In
order
to
obtain
a
symbol
table
for
a
system
library
we
need
to
know
*
the
library
'
s
absolute
path
on
the
file
system
.
On
Windows
we
*
additionally
need
to
know
the
absolute
path
to
the
library
'
s
PDB
file
*
which
we
call
the
binary
'
s
"
debugPath
"
.
*
-
Symbol
tables
are
requested
asynchronously
by
the
profiler
UI
after
the
*
profile
itself
has
been
obtained
.
*
-
When
the
symbol
tables
are
requested
we
don
'
t
want
the
profiler
UI
to
*
pass
us
arbitrary
absolute
file
paths
as
an
extra
defense
against
*
potential
information
leaks
.
*
-
Instead
when
the
UI
requests
symbol
tables
it
identifies
the
library
*
with
a
(
debugName
breakpadId
)
pair
.
We
need
to
map
that
pair
back
to
the
*
absolute
paths
.
*
-
We
get
the
"
trusted
"
paths
from
the
"
libs
"
sections
of
the
profile
.
We
*
trust
these
paths
because
we
just
obtained
the
profile
directly
from
*
Gecko
.
*
-
This
function
builds
the
(
debugName

retains
it

passed
to
the
UI
