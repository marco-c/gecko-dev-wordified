React
uses
a
whitelist
for
attributes
so
we
need
some
way
to
set
*
attributes
it
does
not
know
about
such
as
mozbrowser
.
If
this
were
*
the
only
issue
we
could
use
componentDidMount
or
ref
:
node
=
>
{
}
to
*
set
the
atttibutes
.
In
the
case
of
remote
the
attribute
must
be
set
*
before
the
element
is
added
to
the
DOM
to
have
any
effect
which
we
*
are
able
to
do
with
this
approach
.
