This
test
focuses
on
the
SourceTree
component
where
we
display
all
debuggable
sources
.
*
*
The
first
tests
expand
the
tree
via
manual
DOM
events
.
*
waitForSourcesInSourceTree
(
)
is
a
key
assertion
method
.
Passing

is
important

automatically
expand

This
test
opens
the
SourceTree
manually
via
click
events
on
the
nested
source
*
and
then
adds
a
source
dynamically
and
asserts
it
is
visible
