This
test
focuses
on
the
SourceTree
component
where
we
display
all
debuggable
sources
.
*
*
The
first
two
tests
expand
the
tree
via
manual
DOM
events
(
first
with
clicks
and
second
with
keys
)
.
*
waitForSourcesInSourceTree
(
)
is
a
key
assertion
method
.
Passing
{
noExpand
:
true
}
*
is
important
to
avoid
automatically
expand
the
source
tree
.
*
*
The
following
tests
depend
on
auto
-
expand
and
only
assert
all
the
sources
possibly
displayed
*

then
adds
a

asserts
it
