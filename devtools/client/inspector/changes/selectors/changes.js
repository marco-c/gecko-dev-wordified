In
the
Redux
state
changed
CSS
rules
are
grouped
by
source
(
stylesheet
)
and
stored
in
*
a
single
level
array
regardless
of
nesting
.
*
This
method
returns
a
nested
tree
structure
of
the
changed
CSS
rules
so
the
React
*
consumer
components
can
traverse
it
easier
when
rendering
the
nested
CSS
rules
view
.
*
Keeping
this
interface
updated
allows
the
Redux
state
structure
to
change
without
*
affecting
the
consumer
components
.
