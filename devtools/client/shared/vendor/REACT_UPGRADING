React
has
a
dev
and
prod
version
.
The
dev
version
includes
additional
sanity
checks
and
better
errors
but
at
a
slight
perf
cost
.
The
prod
version
available
on
the
web
is
by
default
minified
but
we
don
'
t
want
a
minified
version
so
we
need
to
build
it
ourselves
.
The
react
.
js
and
react
-
dev
.
js
were
generated
with
the
following
steps
:
*
git
clone
https
:
/
/
github
.
com
/
facebook
/
react
.
git
&
&
cd
react
*
npm
install
*
grunt
build
*
cp
build
/
react
-
with
-
addons
.
js
<
gecko
-
dev
>
/
devtools
/
client
/
shared
/
vendor
/
react
-
dev
.
js
*
NODE_ENV
=
production
grunt
build
*
cp
build
/
react
-
with
-
addons
.
js
<
gecko
-
dev
>
/
devtools
/
client
/
shared
/
vendor
/
react
.
js
The
second
build
produces
a
non
-
minified
React
file
but
with
all
the
sanity
checks
that
incur
a
perf
hit
removed
.
