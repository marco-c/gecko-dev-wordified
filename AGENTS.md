sometimes
on

The
Firefox
repository
is
very
big
and
so
it
isn
'
t
advised
to
blindly
run
grep
or
rg
commands
without
specifying
a
narrow
set
of
directories
to
search
.
There
are
tools
available
to

Tooling
for
Firefox
work

Some
tools
useful
for
Firefox
work
are
available
in
the

MCP
server

Firefox
is
a
very
large
repository
and
it
isn
'
t
efficient
to
search
with
usual
tooling
.
When
working
on
Firefox
you
MUST
use
the
searchfox
-
cli
tool
if
you
want
to
know
about
something
.
Its

show
the
options

probably
want

Use
the

tool
except
if
you
suspect
that
you
need
to
find
information
about
something
that
has
changed
locally
in
which
case
use
rg
or
the
usual
tools
since
